</h2>
</div>
<p>The night was hot and hazy. The aerodrome was in darkness save for a
moving light in the black maw of one of the hangars and a shine from the
open window of the office on the other side of the ground. All the
machines were down and in.</p>
<p>Two men were in the small hut which served as field-headquarters and
office for this particular unit of the Dominion Air Force. They sat at
opposite sides of a large table, one leaning back in his chair with a
cigar in his mouth, the other stooped forward over a map which he
studied intently. Clerks, orderlies, pilots, observers and mechanics all
were gone, with the exceptions of these two and the man with the lantern
across at the hangars.</p>
<p>“Ottawa seems determined to decorate every one who ever flew, be he
alive or dead,” remarked the elder of the two, without removing the
cigar from his mouth and still gazing upward at the low ceiling. “We
seem to have more Military Crosses and such things than we know what to
do with.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir?” returned the younger officer inquiringly, looking up from
the map.</p>
<p>“It seems so to me,” continued Colonel Nasher. “You knew a fellow named
Angus Bruce, I believe.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I knew Angus Bruce.”</p>
<p>“Ottawa suggests a posthumous Military Cross for him.”</p>
<p>The younger officer said nothing to that, although the expression of his
face suggested that he wanted to say a great deal. Instead of speaking
he fell to studying his map again. The line of his mouth was tense. Even
the set of his broad, lean shoulders looked tense. A keen observer would
have noticed a general air of tenseness about him—tenseness of
self-control practiced under difficulties.</p>
<p>“But I think my letter to Ottawa will fix that,” added the colonel,
still speaking around his cigar.</p>
<p>The other looked across the table again.</p>
<p>“Fix it?” he queried.</p>
<p>His voice was low but slightly tremulous.</p>
<p>“Kill it,” replied the colonel.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand you, sir,” said the junior, still speaking quietly.
“Bruce earned it several times, to my personal knowledge.”</p>
<p>“I don’t agree with you. I knew the fellow for years. We used to live in
the same town. There’s a yellow streak in the breed. You can’t make a
silk purse out of a sow’s ear.”</p>
<p>“He had no yellow streak. He proved his courage a dozen times—scores of
times—his courage and his worth.”</p>
<p>“So you say, major.”</p>
<p>At that the major pushed his chair back and stood up.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s what I say!” he cried.</p>
<p>Colonel Nasher sat up straight, plucked his cigar from his mouth and
stared at his second-in-command.</p>
<p>“And I mean what I say,” continued the major, in a loud and shaken
voice. “And I know what I am talking about.”</p>
<p>“But you forget to whom you are talking!” roared the colonel.</p>
<p>“No I don’t,” retorted the younger man, wildly. “I am talking to you—and
there is some true talk coming to you. You’ve been asking for it ever
since I joined this outfit. I know what your game is. You want to get me
out—to make people believe that my nerve is gone and I’m no longer fit
for the service. I’m fit enough—fit for anything but to sit and listen
to you lie about a friend of mine—about the memory of a friend who was
killed over the Boche lines. You’re not fit to name a man like Angus
Bruce. You never saw him fight. You never saw anybody fight. A yellow
streak? I have seen him go up alone after four of them! You’ll swallow
that lie, Colonel Nasher, here and now!”</p>
<p>The colonel got to his feet, glaring. He was a large man with a large
face. The only small things about him were his heart and mind. His eyes
looked like polished gray stones in his red face.</p>
<p>“Your dead friend won’t get his cross and you’ll lose yours!” he cried,
pointing a thick finger at the ribbons on the major’s breast. “I’ll
break you for this, you upstart! Consider yourself under arrest. I’ll
teach you that you’re not in France now!”</p>
<p>The major stepped swiftly and with smooth violence around the end of the
table; and then, quick as a flash, his right fist came in contact with
the colonel’s red chin. Down went the colonel with a crash.</p>
<p>The major stood above his prostrate C. O. for a few seconds, staring
down at the motionless bulk and shaking as if with fever chills.</p>
<p>“What’s the use!” he exclaimed hysterically, turning away. “I’m as
helpless as if I were under French mud with Angus Bruce.”</p>
<p>He took his leather cap and leather coat from a hook on the door, opened
the door and stepped into the dark warm night. He saw the lantern beyond
the level field and hastened across to it.</p>
<p>“I want the old bus out again, Dever,” he said.</p>
<p>“Very good, sir,” replied Dever.</p>
<p>They wheeled the ’plane from the open hangar. The major put on his
leather coat and cap and climbed in. He started the engines and switched
on the internal lights. Then he leaned over and said, “You remember
Major Angus Bruce, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, I remember him well,” replied the man on the ground. “We
don’t forget that kind, sir, do we—nor ever will.”</p>
<p>“A good soldier, Angus Bruce.”</p>
<p>“One of the smartest and bravest in the Old Force, sir. He crashed his
sixth just a day after you crashed your seventh, sir.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I remember it. Now get me off, Dever, and then go over to the
office and see if the colonel wants anything. If he needs a stimulant I
think you’ll find something of the sort in the right-hand drawer on his
side of the table.”</p>
<p>“Very good, sir. When’ll you be back?”</p>
<p>“Not before sunrise. Don’t wait up for me.”</p>
<p>Dever gave a downward heave on a propeller-blade. Then the wide, white
’plane slid, roaring, into the darkness.</p>
<hr class='tbk' />
<p>Akerley was flying low; and when he saw the little smudge of yellow
light on the black expanse beneath him he went down to it like a
wing-weary duck to the sheen of water. The numbness of indifference and
confusion that had possessed him for an hour or more passed swiftly from
his brain and spirit. His nerves snapped back to duty and his vision
cleared. The light expanded to his gaze as he neared it and by its form
and position he judged it to come from an open doorway of modest
dimensions. It streamed out upon a green level; and he reasoned
hopefully that the level ground would, very likely, be of considerable
extent in front of the building. So he shut off his flagging engines,
swooped around, dipped and flattened.</p>
<p>The machine ran, swaying and lurching, through old Gaspard’s half-grown
oats; and just as Akerley was about to congratulate himself on the
soundness of his reasoning, the right plane came in violent contact with
an ancient and immovable stump of pine.</p>
<p>Akerley recovered consciousness in the dew-wet grain, in the gray dawn.
He lay on his left side, with his left shoulder dug into the soft soil.
The sappy stems of the young oats had saved his face and head from
serious injury; but there was blood on his cheek. He felt a stab of pain
through his shoulder as he sat up and looked dizzily around; and his
first thought was that a bullet had gone through him. Then he remembered
his changed situation and altered circumstances.</p>
<p>He saw the machine on its nose beside the sturdy old stump. One wing was
ripped off and twisted hopelessly. That sight did not distress him, for
he had finished with the machine anyway. It had served his purpose.</p>
<p>He sat in a field of half-grown oats, ten or twelve acres in extent,
rimmed all around by dense forest. A large log-house and two barns stood
in a group near the farther edge of the clearing.</p>
<p>Akerley got slowly and painfully to his feet and moved toward the house,
the door of which stood open. He had been so badly shaken by his throw
from the machine that he had to sink to his knees and right hand several
times on the way. He reached the door-step at last and sat down on it.
So far, he had not caught a glimpse of anything human and alive. A few
hens scratched about a stable door and a small black dog eyed him
inquiringly from a distance.</p>
<p>The door stood open upon the main apartment of the house, which was very
evidently kitchen and living-room in one. It contained a long,
high-backed settle against one wall, a deal table against another and a
dresser of unstained pine against a third. Plates, platters and bowls,
yellow, blue-and-white and a few adorned with flowery designs in
gorgeous hues, and a big brown tea-pot, stood on the shelves of the
dresser. There was a wide chimney with a fireplace containing fire-dogs
and a crane with dangling pot-hooks; and to one side of the chimney,
with an elbow of pipe leading into the rough masonry, stood a small
stove. Both hearth and stove were cold. A few rag mats, and two deer
skins worn bald in patches, lay on the floor of squared timbers. The log
walls were sheathed with thin strips of cedar, the partitions and
ceiling were of wide pine boards. Rough hewn rafters ran across the
ceiling. There was no sign of plaster anywhere in that wide room. There
were closed doors in the partitions to the right and left, and one in
the log wall beside the chimney, opposite the open door. A wide ladder
went steeply up from a corner to an open trap in the ceiling.</p>
<p>Akerley got stiffly to his feet and crossed the threshold. He knocked
sharply on the open door; he crossed to the stove and hit the top of the
oven with the poker; he shouted, “Wake up!”, “Good morning,” and “Is any
one at home?” Knocks and shouts alike failed to produce a response of
any sort except from the little black dog. The dog looked in at him
across the threshold with an expression of sharp but good-humored
curiosity on his black face; and when the intruder addressed him
familiarly by the name of “Pup” and asked him where the devil every one
was gone to, he wriggled with delight but continued to keep his
distance.</p>
<p>Akerley opened the back door and looked out, under the roof of a narrow
porch and across a wood-yard, at the high edge of the forest. Sunshine
was flooding over the clearing by this time like a bright, level tide.
The porch ran the length of the house; and in its shelter stood an
upright churn, a couple of tubs, and two benches supporting empty pails
and pans and “creamers” which shone like silver in the sun. Also, there
were two old splint-bottom rocking-chairs on the porch; and on the seat
of one of these lay an open book on its face.</p>
<p>Akerley stepped out onto the rough hewn flooring of the porch and stared
about him inquiringly. Here was a comfortable and well-kept home; here
were the material things of peaceful industry and leisure; but where had
the people gone to? He knew that they had been at home last night, for
the light from their open door had guided him to his landing. He sat
down in one of the chairs, for he was still weak from the shaking and
the pain in his shoulder, and lifted the book from the other.</p>
<p>“My hat!” he exclaimed. “Where am I?”</p>
<p>The book was the elder Dumas’ “Three Musketeers,” printed in the
original language of that great and industrious romancer.</p>
<p>He replaced the book and reëntered the house. The dog, who had advanced
as far as the middle of the room, immediately beat a wriggling retreat
to his old position beyond the threshold. Akerley ascended the ladder
and searched through the loft, which was divided into three chambers—a
bedroom, a storeroom and a lumber-room. Nobody was hidden there. He
descended and opened the closed doors off the main room. Behind them he
found a pantry and storeroom combined, a long apartment containing a
carpenter’s table and several large grain bins, and a bedroom. They were
all as empty of humanity as the kitchen and upper floor.</p>
<p>It was now fifteen minutes past six by the clock on the chimney-shelf;
and the intruder felt keen stirrings of hunger. He had not eaten since
an early hour of the previous day. He made a fire in the stove with
kindlings and dry wood which lay ready to hand, and then looked about
for water. There was none in the house. He took an empty pail from the
porch and followed a path that ran from the chip-yard into the green
gloom of the forest. He found the spring within ten paces of the edge of
the clearing, roofed over and fenced about with poles. The clear water
brimmed the oblong basin that had been dug for it; and in the lower end
of the basin stood two tin “creamers” held down by a stone-weighted
board across their tops.</p>
<p>“Last night’s milk, I suppose,” said Akerley, as he filled his pail.
“What about this morning’s milking? Are they leaving that to me, I
wonder?”</p>
<p>He returned to the house and cooked and ate a very good breakfast. He
found everything he wanted—bread, tea, sugar, butter, bacon and jam.
Then he lit a cigarette.</p>
<p>“I won’t wash dishes, anyway,” he said, “I draw the line at that. I’ll
dirty every cup and plate in the house first. But I suppose I’ll have to
go and look for those blasted cows.”</p>
<p>His shoulder felt better, but still very stiff. He placed a dish of
bread and milk on the floor and pointed it out to the little dog, then
hung two tin pails on his arm and went out to look for the dairy herd.
On his way, he searched the barns. The stables were empty, save for a
few dozens of scratching fowls. He found a pig-house of two pens and
open runs behind one of the barns. One suite was occupied by a large sow
and the other by five promising pink youngsters. They all greeted the
sight of him enthusiastically.</p>
<p>“Pigs!” he exclaimed. “I suppose they think I’ll attend to their
confounded pigs.”</p>
<p>He entered the pig-house and found there a small iron stove and large
iron pot. The pot, which had a capacity of about two flour barrels, was
half-full of a stiff sort of porridge. Beside it stood a spade with a
short handle. He set the pails on the floor and spaded a quantity of
this mess into the troughs to right and left. The exertion sent stabs of
pain through his injured shoulder. He glared at the big sow on his right
and the small pigs on his left, who had dashed in from their yards at
the sounds of his spading and were now sunk to the eyes and knees in
their untidy breakfast.</p>
<p>“They’d better come home before that pot is empty,” he said. “If they
think I’m going to cook for a bunch of pigs while they go fishing
they’re everlastingly mistaken.”</p>
<p>The big field of oats spread completely around the barns, but from the
barn-yard a fenced road led through the crop to a second clearing behind
a screen of trees. This clearing, which was rough pasture, was fenced
and occupied by three horses and a foal; and in a small, square yard at
the near edge of it stood five cows in expectant attitudes. One cow had
a bell at her neck, which she ding-donged restlessly.</p>
<p>Akerley had learned to milk when he was a small boy and used to visit a
brother of his mother’s housekeeper in the country. The knack of it is
not easily lost, though the muscles of hands and wrists may suffer from
neglect of the exercise. He milked the five cows, grumbling at the
necessity; and he was glad that two of them proved to be remarkably
light producers. He then let them into the pasture with the horses; and
upon seeing them hasten toward a green clump of alders in a far corner,
he knew that he would not have to carry water for them. Owing to the
painful condition of his shoulder, he was forced to make two trips with
the milk. He found the house still unoccupied, save by the little black
dog.</p>
<p>One thing led naturally to another; and Akerley found no time that
morning to consider the graver problems of his situation. He was
conscientious to an extraordinary degree and knew just enough about farm
life to feel the responsibilities of his peculiar position. Milking led
to the care of milk and the washing of creamers. He carried the skimmed
milk to the pigs, cooked and ate his dinner, then fell asleep in one of
the chairs on the porch.</p>
<p>Akerley slept heavily and senselessly for several hours; but at last his
head slipped along the back of the chair into so uncomfortable a
position that his brain shook off its torpor and busied itself with the
spinning of dreams. They were startling and distressing dreams. They
were of flying in fogs and over strange cities and through resounding
barrages, of fighting against fearful odds, and of
falling—falling—falling. Crash!—and he awoke just in time to save
himself from tumbling sideways off the chair.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes wide and straightened himself with a gasp. His heart
was going at a terrific rate, his nerves were all twanging, and for a
second or two he felt numb with fear. Then he saw the afternoon sunlight
along the edge of the forest and remembered. He laughed with relief.</p>
<p>“This is better,” he said to the black dog, who sat on the edge of the
porch and faced him with an expression of undiminished interest and
expectancy. “Yes, a great deal better, you black pup. Better for the
nerves and better for everything—and you can take a flight-commander’s
word for it, Pup.”</p>
<p>So great was his relief at awakening from his nightmares to those
peaceful and rustic surroundings that, for several minutes, his mood and
manner of whimsical complaint were forgotten. He surveyed the yard, with
its cord wood, chips and saw-horse; and the path leading into the brown
and green shades of the forest; and the dog wagging its tail in front of
him, with the keenest satisfaction. His appreciative glance lowered to
the floor between his feet and the dog.</p>
<p>“What’s this!” he exclaimed, staring. “Where’d it come from?”</p>
<p>He stooped forward and picked up a piece of folded white paper. It was
written on with pencil, in a round hand, as follows:—</p>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>
<p style='text-indent:0'>“<i>Sir</i>; My Grandfather refuses to return for he will not believe that
you are not a devil. He is not an educated man, and has not been more
than forty miles from here in the last thirty years. He has always
believed in the Devil, but never in aëroplanes or anything of that kind,
although I have shown him pictures of them. I am glad you were not
killed and sorry you broke your aëroplane. You did not find the calves,
which are in a pen at the far end of the cow-stable. I fed them a few
minutes ago. The cows do not pasture with the horses, as Jess kicks
cows—so I let them out. The bars in the brush-fence are just beyond the
brook among the alders. I shall bring my grandfather back to the house
as soon as he recovers from his foolish fright; but how soon that will
be I cannot state definitely, for he is a very stubborn old man. I have
left him asleep in the woods. He made me promise not to speak to you.</p>
<div style='margin-top:1em; text-align:right; margin-right:4em;'>Yours very truly,</div>
<div style='text-align:right; font-variant:small-caps'>Catherine MacKim.”</div>
</div>
<p>Akerley read with astonished haste, studied the signature, then re-read
the letter slowly from the beginning. This done, he raised his head and
gazed searchingly around him.</p>
<p>He entered the house and looked at the clock on the chimney-piece. It
pointed to four; and he corrected the watch on his wrist by it. Again he
read the note before putting it carefully away in his pocket-book. He
stood for some time in the center of the room, deep in thought,
fingering his stubbly chin. Then he entered the bedroom.</p>
<p>This was evidently Grandfather’s sleeping-place and nothing else. Its
walls of natural wood were bare save for a few earthy and unshapely
garments of coarse material hanging from nails. A pair of mud-caked
boots with high legs stood crookedly in a corner. On the window-sill lay
a black clay pipe, the heel of a plug of black tobacco and a shabby
spectacle-case. The only articles of furniture were a large chest and a
bed. The chest was not locked; and Akerley rummaged through it in search
of a razor. He found an ancient suit of black broadcloth, a leather
wallet fat with ten and twenty-dollar bank notes, flannel shirts, rifle
cartridges rolled up in a woolen sock, a packet of papers, cakes of
tobacco, suits of winter underclothes so aggressively wooly that his
back itched as he beheld them, a Bible, a cardboard box full of
trinkets—and, last of all, a razor in a stained red case.</p>
<p>He had to go up to the bedroom in the loft to find a mirror; but he did
not shave there, feeling that he would be taking an unwarrantable
liberty in doing so. With the mirror and a purloined cake of pink soap
he returned to the kitchen. Nothing like a shaving-brush was to be
found, high or low, so he did without. The pink soap proved to be a poor
producer of lather, and the ancient razor seemed to prefer either
sliding or digging to cutting; and so it was twenty minutes to five
before Akerley considered himself shaved. He returned the mirror and
soap to their places and went out to his crippled machine.</p>
<p>Akerley had no further use for the plane. He felt that it had fulfilled
its mission, quite apart from the fact that it was damaged beyond
immediate repair with the tools and materials at hand. He judged by the
atmosphere and appearance of his surroundings and the fact that the old
man of the place had mistaken him for a devil, that he had gone far
enough. And the nearest supply of petrol was sure to be many weary miles
away. So much the better—for petrol stood for the very things he was
most anxious to avoid at this particular stage of his career. Now he was
anxious to put the machine out of sight in the shortest possible time,
and for a few minutes he seriously contemplated breaking it to pieces
and burning and burying the fragments. But he decided against this
violent course. He hadn’t the dull toughness of heart for the task; for
this plane had served him well, as many others had served him well and
truly in the past. So he set briskly to work at dismantling it.</p>
<p>It was after seven o’clock when Akerley went for the cows. He found them
waiting outside the bars in the brush fence among the alders, yarded
them and milked them. He then fed the calves and pigs, prepared and ate
his own supper, and returned to his work on the machine. Later, he found
and lit a lantern. It was close upon midnight when his task was
completed to his satisfaction. Then he threw himself, boots and all, on
the old man’s bed, and sank into dreamless sleep.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER II</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE GIRL AND THE MAN</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>The twilight of dawn was brightening over the clearing when Akerley was
suddenly awakened by the grip of fingers on his injured shoulder. He
could not have leapt back to consciousness more swiftly and violently if
a knife had been driven into him. He sat up with a jerk and opened his
eyes in the same instant of time; and fear shone visibly in his eyes for
a fraction of a second. The look of fear gave place to one of relief,
and that changed in a wink to an expression of polite and embarrassed
surprise.</p>
<p>A girl stood beside the bed, staring at him wide-eyed. Her lips were
parted and she breathed hurriedly.</p>
<p>“Get up,” she whispered. “You must hide in the woods. Grandfather is
coming. Climb out the window and run.”</p>
<p>He swung his feet to the floor and stood up before her.</p>
<p>“But why should I run and hide?” he asked.</p>
<p>She placed her hands on his breast and pushed him backward until he
brought up against the wall beside the open window.</p>
<p>“He will kill you,” she replied. “He has his rifle. Get out, quick, and
hide in the woods. Please go! And watch the house. And I’ll tell you
later. Crawl away. Don’t let him see you.”</p>
<p>“But why does he want to shoot me?”</p>
<p>“Go! Go! I don’t want you to be killed!”</p>
<p>“I am not afraid of any old man with a rifle!”</p>
<p>The girl’s eyes blazed and the color faded out of her cheeks. She raised
her right hand as if she would strike him in the face. Daunted and
bewildered, Akerley turned quickly and slipped out of the window into
the dew-wet grass. He moved toward the edge of the woods by the shortest
line, on his hands and knees, without pausing once to look back. Upon
reaching the shelter of bushes and round spruces along the front of the
forest, he lay flat and turned and surveyed the house and clearing. His
shoulder hurt him, and he felt angry and hungry and generally abused;
but his mind was soon diverted from himself by the sudden appearance of
a tall old man within fifteen or twenty paces of where he lay.</p>
<p>The old man stared at the house from beneath the brim of a wide and
weather-stained felt hat. Abundant white whiskers showed with startling
distinctness against the breast of his dark shirt. He held a rifle in
his right hand, at the short trail. After standing motionless for half a
minute, he stooped almost double and advanced toward the house with long
strides. He reached the porch and vanished from view through the back
door.</p>
<p>“She was right,” soliloquized Akerley. “The old bird is out for blood
and no mistake. He certainly has his nerve with him—if he still thinks
I’m a devil.”</p>
<p>He lay still, watching the house. The minutes dragged past; and his
hunger and the soreness of his shoulder again attracted his attention.
Presently the girl appeared in the doorway, paused there for a moment
and then stepped out onto the porch with her grandfather close at her
heels. The old man was in the act of passing her when she turned swiftly
and halted him, and stayed him with a grip of both hands on the front of
his shirt. Akerley, watching intently, again forgot his discomfort and
hunger. He knew something of the strength of those small hands.</p>
<p>“I hope she’ll pull out his blasted whiskers,” he muttered.</p>
<p>The two were evidently of different opinions on some matter of
importance. The old man seemed to be all for leaving the porch
immediately, and the girl for having him remain there. He waved his left
hand violently. He waved his right hand, in which the steel of the
rifle-barrel shone blue. She continued to cling to the front of his
shirt. It was plain to be seen that they argued the point hotly. He
side-stepped toward the edge of the porch and she pulled him back
sharply to his former ground. He struggled to get away and she struggled
to retain her hold on him. He broke away suddenly and fell backwards off
the edge of the raised floor. It was a drop of about two feet. The rifle
flew from his grasp as he struck the ground. He lay on his back for a
few seconds, then turned over and raised himself to his hands and knees.
From that position he got slowly to his feet. He stood facing Akerley’s
hiding-place for a moment, swaying uncertainly, then staggered forward a
few paces, reeled suddenly, fell heavily on his face and lay still. The
girl sprang down from the porch and knelt beside him.</p>
<p>Akerley saw the girl make several attempts to get the old man to his
feet. He left his cover after the third unsuccessful attempt and
approached the yard. He was half-way to the porch when the girl raised
her head and saw him. She signalled him to make haste; and he
immediately broke into a run.</p>
<p>“He is hurt!” she exclaimed, breathlessly. “He is unconscious. He has
not opened his eyes since he fell. There’s no doctor this side of
Boiling Pot. What am I to do?”</p>
<p>“He is stunned, that’s all,” replied Akerley. “He breathes right enough,
and his heart is working away like a good one. Very likely he knocked
the back of his head on a stone or something when he crashed. We had
better carry him in-doors, I think, and pour some water over him.”</p>
<p>Akerley lifted him by the shoulders, the girl gathered him up by the
knees, and so they carried him into the house and laid him on his own
bed. Akerley asked if there were any brandy or whiskey on the premises.</p>
<p>“Not for him!” she cried. And then, in a lower tone, “There is some
brandy, but I have hidden it from him,” she continued. “It is the worst
thing in the world for him, for it inflames his temper; and I think it
is his temper that is the matter with him, mostly. He has been like that
twice before, and both times he was in a terrible rage.”</p>
<p>“Pleasant company, I don’t think,” remarked Akerley. “But the trouble
isn’t entirely bad temper this time, Miss MacKim. Here’s the bump where
he assaulted something hard with the back of his skull. It doesn’t seem
serious—but he is very old, I suppose.”</p>
<p>The girl investigated the bump with her fingers.</p>
<p>“I’ll bathe that,” she said. “See, he looks better already. It was
foolish of me to be afraid. Please get out of sight before he opens his
eyes. Get your breakfast now, please, and make as little noise about it
as possible; and I’ll keep him here until you have finished, even if he
recovers consciousness in the meantime.”</p>
<p>“Does he still think I am a devil?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes—and that it is his sacred duty to kill you,” she replied. “He was
terrified at first; but he is not at all afraid of you now. The very
thought of you, and of the way you frightened him when you rushed down
from the sky, fills him with fury.”</p>
<p>“But am I to hide from him always?”</p>
<p>“Always? Did you come here to settle for life?”</p>
<p>“My machine is smashed and I have dismantled it; and I need a rest.”</p>
<p>“You will not get much rest with Grandfather hunting you all the time;
and there are other and more usual ways of leaving here than by
aëroplane. But go now—quick!”</p>
<p>Akerley left the room and closed the door behind him. He lit a fire in
the stove stealthily, boiled water and made tea. He did not fry bacon,
for fear that the smell of it might start the old man into action again;
so he breakfasted on bread and butter and jam. He was about to light a
cigarette—the last one in his case—when the girl appeared from the old
man’s bedroom. She came very close to him, with a finger on her lip for
warning.</p>
<p>“He has come around, but he is very weak and shaken,” she whispered. “He
seems quite dazed, just as he did the other times; but he will soon
recover his wits and energy, you may be sure. He may be like this all
day, or perhaps only for a few hours; and then he’ll be out with the
rifle again, looking for you. What have you done with your aëroplane?”</p>
<p>Akerley eyed her steadily and thoughtfully before replying.</p>
<p>“I have hidden the parts here and there,” he said. “I’ll show you, any
time you say. One plane is badly smashed, but not hopelessly. I may mend
it some day; but just now the important thing for me is to have all the
parts out of sight.”</p>
<p>“So that Grandfather can’t find them and destroy them?” she queried.</p>
<p>“That is one reason,” he replied. “The fact is, I should not like any
one from outside to find any trace of the old bus around here. It might
prove very awkward for me. The less known about me and the machine the
better for me, Miss MacKim. If I tell you why I’ll put myself at your
mercy—which I shall do sometime when we can talk in more security. Now I
think I had better milk and do the chores.”</p>
<p>“Are you in danger?” she whispered.</p>
<p>“I shall be glad to explain my position to you, as far as possible, at
the first opportunity,” he answered, smiling. “But there are other
things to do now that need to be done quick—the milking, for one—and if
I could get hold of your grandfather’s ammunition I’d extract the charge
from every cartridge. Then I’d feel less uneasy. My nerves are not in
the best shape, as it is.”</p>
<p>She went to the front door with him and instructed him to keep out of
line of the old man’s window, not to bring the milk to the house but to
leave it on the floor of the larger barn, and to remain in the barn
until he saw her again.</p>
<p>“And I’ll bring you every rifle-cartridge I can find,” she concluded.</p>
<p>He thanked her and started off to attend to the cows; but before he had
gone a dozen paces he turned and came back to where she still stood on
the threshold.</p>
<p>“I had forgotten the milk-pails,” he explained.</p>
<p>After milking and turning the cows out, he fed the pigs. He could not
feed the calves, for he had not brought their breakfast of hay-tea and
skimmed milk from the house. He retired to the barn then and gave his
mind to very serious and painful thought.</p>
<p>“What’s the use?” he exclaimed, at last. “Thinking won’t undo what’s
already done. The past is out of my hands—and I hope to heaven it is
buried! I can only help myself in the future.”</p>
<p>The girl found him a few minutes later. She carried a small basket
containing sixty cartridges.</p>
<p>“These are all I could find,” she said. “I took them from the box in his
room, and from behind the clock, and from the rifle and even from his
pockets. He is feeling much stronger already.”</p>
<p>She took up the pails of milk and was about to go when Akerley begged
her to wait a minute. He produced a knife of parts from a pocket and
with one of its numerous attachments pried the bullet out of a cartridge
and extracted the explosive charge. Then he refixed the bullet in the
empty shell and handed it to the girl.</p>
<p>“Please put that in his rifle,” he said. “Nothing will go off but the
cap when he pulls the trigger on that. I’ll have the rest of them
fool-proof in a couple of hours.”</p>
<p>She complimented him on his cleverness, told him not to budge from the
barn until her return, and went away with the milk and the harmless
cartridge. He was very busy throughout the next two hours. He counted
the seconds of the third hour, paced the dusty floor and looked out
every minute.</p>
<p>She came at last, with his dinner in a basket covered with a linen
napkin. Everything looked as right as could be to him then—and he did
not know why. He thought it was because he felt hungry. His pleasure lit
his eyes upon beholding her and sounded in his voice when he welcomed
her; and these things did not escape her notice and at once pleased and
puzzled her.</p>

<p class='caption'>“THEY SAT SIDE BY SIDE ON A SMALL HEAP OF STRAW.”</p>
</div>
<p>They sat side by side on a small heap of straw in a corner of the
threshing-floor, and she set out the dinner at their feet—sliced cold
chicken, bread and butter, pickles, two large wedges of Washington pie
and a pitcher of hot coffee.</p>
<p>“I left Grandfather eating his in bed, so I’ll have mine with you,” she
said.</p>
<p>She told him that the old man had recovered sufficiently to demand his
rifle, and that she had placed the chargeless cartridge in the breech
before giving it to him.</p>
<p>“He still thinks it was a devil who lit in the oats,” she ran on, “so if
you intend to stay here for some time we must think of a way of leading
him to believe that you are not the person who came down from the sky.
You must get some other clothes, and a pack, and walk into the clearing
as if you had come in all the way from Boiling Pot on foot. I may be
able to fix over some of his things so that he won’t recognize them.
Haven’t you a hat? And is that your only coat? You must have been very
cold up in the air.”</p>
<p>“I have a cap and a wool-lined leather coat,” he replied. “They are both
hidden away with the engine of the poor old bus; and if I am wise I will
hide this one, too.”</p>
<p>She looked at him curiously, and he returned her gaze gravely.</p>
<p>“This is a military coat, isn’t it?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, a khaki service jacket.”</p>
<p>“You are a soldier, then.”</p>
<p>“An officer of the Royal Air Force.”</p>
<p>“I knew you were a soldier when I saw you asleep in the chair yesterday.
I knew by that ribbon.”</p>
<p>She placed the tip of a finger on the left breast of his jacket, and he
kinked his neck and looked down at it.</p>
<p>“The Legion of Honor. So you have seen that ribbon before.”</p>
<p>“I have it—the cross and ribbon. It belonged to my Grandfather MacKim.
He won it in the Crimean War.”</p>
<p>“That old boy?”</p>
<p>“No, not that one. His name is Javet, Gaspard Javet—and he was never a
soldier. What are the other ribbons?”</p>
<p>“One is the Military Cross and the others are service medals. But tell
me about your Grandfather MacKim, please.”</p>
<p>“Not now. I am the questioner to-day. You came here without being
invited, so I have a right to ask you questions. It is my duty to do
so.”</p>
<p>“Of course it is. It is one of your duties as a hostess. Ask away, and
I’ll tell you the truth or nothing.”</p>
<p>“Very well. Are you in great danger?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. If people from the outside don’t find me or learn that I
am here I shall be safe enough for the present—except from your
grandfather; and I am not seriously afraid of him.”</p>
<p>“But you ran away from something or someone! You flew away! What were
you afraid of, to make you fly away? You are not a coward. What are you
afraid of?”</p>
<p>“Of disgrace for one thing.”</p>
<p>“Have you done a disgraceful deed?”</p>
<p>“No—but you wouldn’t understand. My nerves are not quite right—and I
lost my temper. I struck a senior officer.”</p>
<p>“And you are a soldier! And the king has decorated you!”</p>
<p>“Any soldier would have done it. You would have done it yourself, under
the same circumstances. It was about a friend of mine who is dead. Those
swankers who have never seen the whites of the enemies’ eyes don’t
understand. He lied about him! I got out and up, and flew and lost
myself, and when my petrol was done I made a landing to your light—and
here I am.”</p>
<p>“Did you kill him?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I hope not. I didn’t wait to see. My nerves aren’t right
yet. I hit him with my fist. Any man in my place with an ounce of blood
in him would have done what I did. But I’m afraid that won’t help me
much if they find me, even if he was only knocked out for the count.”</p>
<p>“Listen! It is Grandfather shouting for me. I must go, or he may get out
of bed to look for me. You stay here.”</p>
<p>“For how long?”</p>
<p>“Until I come back—which will be as soon as I can get away. I’ll take
these cartridges. Climb into a mow, and if you hear anyone coming hide
under the hay.”</p>
<p>“I am in your hands. You believe what I have told you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, everything.”</p>
<p>“Even that you would have done it yourself?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I believe that. There!—he is shouting again!”</p>
<p>“Will you bring me something to smoke? I haven’t a cigarette left.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes,” she cried, and ran from the barn.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER III</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>CATHERINE’S PLAN</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>Old Gaspard Javet did not return to the war-path with the celerity
feared by Catherine. He kept to his bed all that afternoon and all the
next day, his rifle on the patchwork quilt beside him, without showing
any sign of his usual energy beyond the power of his voice and an
occasional flash of the eyes. The tumble had given his dry joints and
stiff muscles a painful wrenching; and his mind had also suffered from
the sudden shock of the fall and the emotional explosion that had led to
it. Now and then, for brief periods, his memory of the immediate past
served him faithfully and he thought clearly and violently on the
subject of the unwelcome intruder; and at other times, for hours
together, he lay in a state of peace and mild bewilderment.</p>
<p>To understand this old man, one must know that he was more Scottish than
French, (despite his name), and that a dark old strain of Iroquois blood
ran in his veins. He had lived rough and wild most of the years of his
life, and neither the ministers of the Kirk nor the priests of the
Church of Rome had enjoyed a fair opportunity of shaping him to any
authorized form of religious thought and practice. He had been a scoffer
and unbeliever until past middle-life; but for years now he had been
deeply, and sometimes violently, religious according to his own lights
and to laws of his own conception. Born in the wilderness far north of
the city of Quebec eighty years ago, of a father of two strains of blood
and a mother of three, he had been bred early to self-reliance,
privation, loneliness, and physical dexterity and endurance. He spoke
French and English fluently but incorrectly, several Indian languages
with as much fluency as their vocabularies permitted, and he read
English with difficulty. All his reading was done in Holy Writ; and,
considering the laborious process of that reading, the ease and freedom
of his interpretations were astonishing.</p>
<p>While the old man was confined to his bed, Akerley was permitted almost
unlimited freedom of action; but he was not allowed to enter the house
or intrude on the field of vision of Gaspard’s bedroom window. He milked
the cows, fed the calves and pigs, and hoed in a secluded field of
turnips and corn. For two nights he made his bed in the hay of the big
barn, with blankets brought to him by the girl. She also supplied him
with a clay pipe and tobacco belonging to her grandfather; and though he
had smoked cigarettes for years and the first pipeful made his head
spin, he soon learned to take his tobacco hot and heavy according to the
custom obtaining in those woods. He saw and talked to the girl
frequently during that time. She frankly seized every opportunity of
leaving her grandfather and her household tasks to be with him. She did
not question him further, just then, concerning his deed of violence,
nor did her manner toward him suggest either fear or repugnance after he
had made his confession. And yet her manner was not entirely as it had
been before his frank answers to her questions had placed him at her
mercy. It was changed for the better. It was more considerate of his
feelings. In short, it was the manner of a sympathetic and trusting
friend; and yet she knew nothing more of him, good or bad, than the bad
he had told of himself. He was wise enough, understanding enough, not to
doubt her full recognition of the fact that he had placed his freedom,
his honor and perhaps his life, in her hands. He believed that her
manner of sympathy was sincere. He credited her with a heart of utter
kindness and an unshaken faith in her own instincts concerning the
hearts of others; and he was deeply moved by admiration and gratitude.</p>
<p>She brought him his supper at seven o’clock in the evening of the second
day of his residence in the barn, and went back to the house
immediately. He made short work of the food, then took up a position
behind the barn-yard fence, from which he had a clear view of the house,
and awaited her reappearance. When eight o’clock came with no sight of
her he felt a sudden restlessness and began to pace back and forth. By
half-past eight he was in a fine fume of impatience and anxiety; and
then he suddenly realized the silliness of it and made bitter fun of
himself. She was safe, there in her own home not two hundred yards
away—so why worry about her? And who was he to worry about her? She had
never heard of him, nor he of her, four days ago. Why should he expect
her to come hurrying back to talk to him? Wouldn’t it be the natural
thing for her to prefer her grandfather’s company to his?</p>
<p>He asked himself all these questions and answered them all with
disinterested logic; and yet he felt no less anxious and no less
impatient. He climbed the fence and stared accusingly at the house. He
was joined by the little black dog, with whom he was now on familiar
terms. Together they strolled to the far side of the barns, where
Blackie started a chipmunk along the pasture fence; but Akerley could
not wait to watch the excitement. He left the chase in full cry and
hastened back to a point from which he could see the house as if he had
been absent a year. It had been out of his sight for exactly five
minutes; and still she was not on her way. He wondered if he had said
anything that could possibly have offended her, anything that she could
possibly have misunderstood, and wracked his memory for every word that
they had exchanged since morning. He could not recall anything of the
kind or anything in her manner to suggest anything of the kind. Again he
took himself to task for his foolishness.</p>
<p>“Your nerves are crossed, Tom Akerley,” he said. “Your wind is up in
vertical gusts. Your brains are addled. You are so devilish lonely that
you’ve gone dotty. You expect a girl who doesn’t know you from Adam to
sit around and entertain you all the time and neglect her poor old
grandfather; and it isn’t because you are used to it, old son, for no
other woman ever neglected so much as a dog to entertain you. Buck up!
Pull yourself together! Forget it!”</p>
<p>He filled and lit the clay pipe and sat on the top rail of the fence and
smoked. Twilight deepened to dusk, the stars appeared, bats flickered
and fire-flies blinked their sailing sparks; and lamplight glowed softly
from the windows of the house.</p>
<p>It was long past ten o’clock when Catherine made her appearance,
carrying a lighted lantern in her left hand and a large bundle under her
right arm. She found Akerley on the top rail of the fence. He slid to
his feet the moment the swinging circle of light discovered him, and
strode forward to meet her.</p>
<p>“I was afraid you were never coming,” he said. “I began to fear that the
old man had mistaken you for the devil. What have you there?”</p>
<p>“I thought I’d find you asleep,” she replied. “I didn’t say I was coming
back to-night, you know. But I had to. Grandfather is feeling much
better and will be up and out bright and early in the morning, so I have
had to get these clothes ready for you to-night. And here are an old
quilt and things—a frying-pan and old kettle—to make a pack of. You must
leave here before sunrise and come back about breakfast-time. I’ll show
you the road to come in by now—the road from Boiling Pot.”</p>
<p>Akerley took the bundle from her.</p>
<p>“You have been working all evening for me; and I am not accustomed to
this sort of thing,” he said. “You are a very wonderful person,
Catherine MacKim.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by wonderful?” she asked curiously.</p>
<p>“You are wonderfully kind. I don’t believe there are many girls in the
world who would take the trouble to fit me out like this. I may be
wrong, for I don’t know many girls or women.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t a woman have anything to do with—with what you did?”</p>
<p>“A woman! Bless you, no! What made you think that?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Please put these things in the barn, and then I’ll show
you the road.”</p>
<p>He obeyed and returned to her. She extinguished the lantern.</p>
<p>“He may be awake,” she explained. “He is very restless to-night; and
there is no saying what he might do if he saw a lantern wandering about
the edge of the woods.”</p>
<p>It was a still, vague night of blurred shadows and warm gloom. The dim
stars did no more than mark out the close sky. The girl found a path
through the oats and led the way along it until they came to the edge of
the forest and the opening of the rough track that wound away from old
Gaspard Javet’s clearings to the nearest settlement.</p>
<p>“There has never been a wheel on this end of it,” she said. “We do our
hauling in winter; and we don’t pay road-taxes. Grandfather doesn’t seem
to mind how far out of the world he lives.”</p>
<p>“Thank Heaven for that!” replied Akerley.</p>
<p>They walked for a short distance along this track, feeling the way with
cautious feet and frequently brushing against the dense undergrowth to
right and left. She halted suddenly, so close to him that her shoulder
touched his arm for a moment.</p>
<p>“Do you think you will be able to find it in the morning?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Easily,” he assured her. “It is due south from the house.”</p>
<p>“Yes, just to the right of the two big pines. But that will not be all.
You must invent a story about how you came in, and why, and all sorts of
things. He is slightly mad about devils from the sky, you know. He has
been expecting one. So, to save your life, you had better say that you
lost your canoe and outfit—everything but the quilt and frying-pan—in
the rapids below Boiling Pot.”</p>
<p>“But what is this boiling pot?”</p>
<p>“It is the pool below the falls, and it is also a little settlement,
about fifteen miles from here. We are on the height-o’-land, you know,
and you can’t get to within six miles of us from any direction by water,
even in a canoe. The spring where we cool our creamers and the one in
the pasture are the beginnings of Indian River. But what will you say
about yourself?—who you are and what you are looking for? And what kind
of person will you pretend to be?”</p>
<p>“I’ll think of something to-night—but I wish your grandfather was more
modern and rational. I know a good deal about the woods, though this
part of the country is new to me; and I can use an ax, and manage a
canoe in white water. So don’t worry. I’ll think up something pretty
safe. But have you told him that the devil has cleared out?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I told him so yesterday; and he thinks I am mistaken. Are you sure
that the aëroplane is hidden where he won’t find it? I don’t see how it
can be.”</p>
<p>“I took it to pieces, and the pieces are carefully hidden. I meant to
tell you before what I had done with them. The engines are packed and
stowed away in the little loft over the pig-house. The planes are under
the hay in the small barn, where they should be safe until I can think
of a better place for them. The old machine is scattered as if a shell
had made a direct hit on her. I even took the liberty of putting a few
small but very valuable parts in your room.”</p>
<p>“I found them. They are safe there.”</p>
<p>“So you see, Catherine, I have not only put my own fate in your hands,
but that of the old bus as well. I have not practiced half-measures.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Just that—my liberty and honor. Suppose you were to let people know
that I am here—that a stranger had come here by air? What would become
of me? I might run into the woods and hide—and starve. The game would be
played out and ended, whatever I did.”</p>
<p>“But you have never thought that there was any danger of such a thing!”</p>
<p>“Never. Not for a moment. But what right had I to treat you like this—to
tell you the truth about myself and then throw myself on your mercy? You
must think me a poor thing.”</p>
<p>“You have not asked for mercy from me; and you have told me that any man
of spirit would have done what you did.”</p>
<p>“Any man of spirit and jangled nerves.”</p>
<p>They returned to the barn-yard in silence. There they lit the lantern.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget to put on the old clothes,” she said. “And please give me
that coat now. I will take good care of it, ribbons and all; and I will
give it back to you when you want to fly away from here.”</p>
<p>“I have neither the petrol nor the desire for flight,” he returned.
“There are letters in the pockets, so please hide it securely.”</p>
<p>He took off the jacket, folded it and laid it over her arm.</p>
<p>“Good night,” she said, and hurried away.</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>Akerley lay awake for hours on a blanket spread on a mattress of
innumerable springs—a ton or more of last year’s timothy, bluejoint and
clover. He had air enough, though it was still and warm; for one of the
wide doors stood open and the fingers could be thrust anywhere between
the horizontal poles of which the sides and ends of the barn were
constructed. Only the roof was weather-tight.</p>
<p>His thoughts kept him awake; and yet he let them deal only with the
immediate past and the immediate to-morrow. He did not think backward or
forward beyond this forest-farm. What was the use of brooding over the
past or dreaming of the future? After much reflection, he decided on the
character in which he was to emerge from the woods into the clearing and
encounter that formidable old Gaspard Javet. He would come as a
backwoodsman from the upper waters of the main river, two hundred miles
or more away to the west and south, looking for new land and seclusion.
He had known that country well, years ago. This was a part that he could
act with a degree of interest and realism; and he would explain it to
the old man—sooner or later, as circumstances determined—that the
game-wardens of his old stamping-grounds wanted him in connection with a
little matter of spearing salmon at night by the light of a torch. The
confession of a crime against the Game Laws was not likely to prejudice
the old woodsman against him; and this was a particularly mild offense.
He knew enough of back-countrymen to believe that his story would excite
Gaspard’s sympathy—if Gaspard were true to type.</p>
<p>He worked out his part carefully, giving all his thought to it until he
considered it to be as nearly perfect as was possible to bring it before
the actual performance. He saw that certain details of character and
action would have to be left until the illumination of the psychological
moment. As the thing had to be done, it must be well done—with all his
brain, all his will and all his skill. If not, then it was not worth
attempting. This was the spirit in which he had set his hand and mind to
every task, congenial or otherwise, in the lost past. Success had been
won by him again and again in this spirit; and though the task before
him was but a play, a game, the stakes for which he was to play were
serious enough to give it the dignity of a great adventure. The stakes
were honor and freedom.</p>
<p>Still he did not sleep. Invention seemed to have agitated his mind. He
continued to keep his thoughts within the former limits of time, but he
could not soothe them to rest. They made pictures for him of every one
of his waking hours since his first awaking among the young oats in the
gray dawn. He heard mice rustling in the hay and scampering on the
rafters. At last he slept. He awoke sharply at the first hint of dawn.
He continued to lie still for a little while, recalling the details of
his plan of action for the new day. Then he donned the ancient and
rustic garments which Catherine had brought him and hid his own shirt
and breeches. His high, moccasin-toed boots were in part with his new
character. He hid his wrist-watch and identification disc, then took up
his bundle and left the barn. He made his way swiftly and cautiously to
the nearest point of woods and, behind a screen of saplings, to the
road. He followed this road toward Boiling Pot for several miles through
the awakening forest. Here and there, in swampy hollows, he encountered
mud-holes and intentionally stepped into them. By the time he sat down
on an old stump and lit his pipe he looked as if he had come a long and
rough journey.</p>
<p>He had not been seated more than ten minutes when his reveries were
disturbed by the appearance of a large young man with an axe on his
shoulder and a pack on his back. The stranger came into view suddenly
and close at hand, around a bend in the track from the direction of
Boiling Pot.</p>
<p>He halted abruptly at sight of Akerley.</p>
<p>“Good day,” said Akerley, coolly.</p>
<p>“Where’d you come from?” exclaimed the other.</p>
<p>“I’m a stranger in these parts,” returned Akerley; “and what I want to
know is, where’ve I got to?”</p>
<p>“Into the woods, that’s where. But you know where you come from, don’t
you? You ain’t just been born right here, I reckon.”</p>
<p>“Maybe I was.”</p>
<p>“Say, you know where you’re headin’ for, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Sure thing. I’m heading for somewhere north of here on this track.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s got a name, ain’t it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“T’ell you say! Where do you cal’late to fetch up at?”</p>
<p>“Somewhere quite a way north of this—if I don’t have to spend all day
answering questions.”</p>
<p>“Looka here, friend, you don’t want to git too cussed sassy.”</p>
<p>“Friend nothing! I choose my friends.”</p>
<p>“Say, d’you reckon you’re talkin’ to me?”</p>
<p>“That’s what I am dead sure of. It’s you I am talking to; and unless you
change your line of conversation for the better pretty quick I’ll quit
talking.”</p>
<p>The big young man in the road flung down his ax and pack, uttered a
string of blistering language and spat on the palms of his hands.</p>
<p>“What’s the idea?” queried Akerley, still smoking his pipe, still
hunched forward with his elbows on his knees.</p>
<p>The other raised and flipped his feet about as if in the opening steps
of a popular rustic dance, and at the same time began to chant in
sing-song tones of a marked nasal quality.</p>
<p>“Stan’ up an’ take yer medicine, ye pore skunk,” he chanted. “Git up
onto yer hind legs so’s I kin knock ye off’n ’em again, ye slab-sided
mistake. Git onto yer splayed feet, or I’ll sure lam ye in the lantern
right where ye set.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you want to dance or fight,” said Akerley, calmly but
clearly, “but I’ll tell you this—I don’t feel like dancing. And I warn
you not to start anything else, for I am a smart man with my hands.”</p>
<p>“Git up,” sang the other, continuing to jink about on his booted feet
without shifting his ground. “Git up so’s I kin swing onto ye. Stan’ up
on yer feet, dad blast ye, or git down onto yer prayer-handles an’ say
ye’re bested already—for I’m Ned Tone, the heaviest hitter in Injun
River.”</p>
<p>“So be it—but never say that I didn’t warn you,” replied Akerley, laying
aside his pipe.</p>
<p>Then he complied with Ned Tone’s reiterated request with speed and
violence suggestive of the releasing of tempered springs within him. His
feet touched the ground in the same instant of time that his right fist
touched the cheek of the heaviest hitter on Injun River. That was a
glancing blow. Ned Tone turned completely around in his tracks, but he
did not fall. He staggered and lurched. He recovered his balance quickly
and plunged at his antagonist. He spat blood as he plunged, for his
cheek had been cut against his teeth. He flailed a murderous blow—but it
returned harmlessly to him through the non-resistant air. He jumped
again, quick as thought, with a jab and a hook.</p>
<p>Akerley employed all his skill of defense, for he realized in a moment
that the big bushwhacker was a practical fighter and that he possessed
agility as well as weight. In height and reach there was little to
choose between them—but that little was in favor of the woodsman.
Akerley’s left shoulder was still tender; and when he caught a swing on
it like the kick of a mule he gasped with pain and realized that now was
the time for him to do all that he knew how for all that he was worth.
His left was useless for offense, but he managed to keep it up so that
it looked dangerous. After a little more clever foot-work, which seemed
to bewilder and madden the heaviest hitter on Indian River, he stepped
close in and did his very best at the very top of his speed.</p>
<p>Akerley was glad to sit down and press his hands to his head. He felt
dizzy and slightly sick with the pain in his shoulder and neck. The
dizziness and nausea passed almost instantly; but he continued to sit
limp and gaze contemplatively at the sprawled bulk of the heavy hitter.</p>
<p>Ned Tone lay flat on the moss of that woodland road. For a few minutes
he lay face-down; then he turned slowly over onto his broad back, with
grunts of pain. He opened one eye slowly, only to close it immediately.</p>
<p>“Feeling bad?” asked Akerley, drily.</p>
<p>“Kinder that way,” replied Tone, thickly.</p>
<p>“As if you’d had enough, perhaps?”</p>
<p>“Too durned much.”</p>
<p>“You’ll be right as you ever were in a little while, so cheer up. I
didn’t hit you hard.”</p>
<p>“Ye hit me hard enough, I guess—but I ain’t complainin’.”</p>
<p>“You remember that I warned you.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing. I ain’t complainin’ none. Leave me be, can’t ye?”</p>
<p>“I’m talking for your good, just as it was for your own good that I
hammered your ugly mug.”</p>
<p>“Sure. I feel real good.”</p>
<p>Akerley laughed, then took his frying-pan in hand and went along to a
green, alder-grown dip in the road. There he found water, and after
drinking deep and bathing his face, neck and wrists, he filled the pan
and returned to the heavy hitter. Tone drank what he could of that
panful and asked that the rest be poured over his damaged face. Akerley
humored him in this; after which Tone sat up groggily.</p>
<p>“Ready to start?” asked Akerley.</p>
<p>“Start nothin’!” retorted Tone, in a voice of bitter disgust. “I ain’t
goin’ back nor forrards till my grub gives out or my face mends. I’m
makin’ camp right here. I ain’t fit to show myself at Javet’s place nor
yet back home.”</p>
<p>“Javet’s place? Who’s Javet?”</p>
<p>“Gaspard Javet. He’s an old codger got a farm back here in the woods.”</p>
<p>“Is it far from here?”</p>
<p>“Ol’ Gaspard’s farm? Seven or eight mile to the west of this. Ye turn
off jist round that bend. Ye can’t miss the track.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. And where does this road go to?”</p>
<p>“Straight north to nowhere. Maybe ye’d find an old camp if ye went far
enough.”</p>
<p>“Javet’s place for me,” said Akerley, turning and moving away.</p>
<p>“Watch out on yer left,” Ned Tone called after him. “The road to
Gaspard’s clearin’s turns off jist past the next bend.”</p>
<p>The unexpected encounter with the heavy hitter had delayed the
intruder’s plan by nearly an hour, so now he stepped forward briskly.
But he did not feel very brisk. The mill with the big woodsman had been
a more strenuous before-breakfast job than he liked or was accustomed
to; and now his shoulder and neck felt even worse than when he had first
opened his eyes in the young oats in the gray dawn. He decided to blame
the imaginary accident in the rapids below Boiling Pot for the crippled
condition of his left shoulder.</p>
<p>When he issued from the green shade of the forest into the wide light of
Gaspard’s clearings he saw that the front door of the house stood open
and smoke trailed straight up into the sunshine from the gray chimney.
He moved slowly but unfalteringly toward the house.</p>
<p>He had not gone far before Catherine appeared in the doorway, only to
vanish instantly. Then old Gaspard Javet appeared, with the rifle in the
crook of his right arm. The devil-hunter stepped across the threshold
and stood with a hand raised to shade his eyes.</p>
<p>Akerley thought of the extracted cordite and smiled. He was more than
half-way to the house before the old man broke his dramatic attitude in
front of the door and moved forward with the obtrusive rifle at the
port.</p>
<p>“What are you doing with that gun?” cried Akerley, halting. “Do you take
me for a moose? What’s the matter with you, anyhow?”</p>
<p>Old Gaspard Javet continued to advance with long and even strides. He
came to a standstill within three paces of the intruder and regarded him
searchingly for several seconds. The young man returned the gaze
steadily.</p>
<p>“I’m out gunnin’ for a devil,” said Gaspard. “At fust glimp I kinder
hoped you was him, but now I reckon ye ain’t. Ye’re in luck. Hev ye seen
him by any chance?”</p>
<p>“Seen who?”</p>
<p>“The devil.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know him by sight.”</p>
<p>“He’s somewheres ’round in these woods.”</p>
<p>“I met a fellow back along that track a few miles who may be a devil.
His temper was bad enough; but he said his name was Ned Tone. I haven’t
seen anyone else.”</p>
<p>“Ned Tone, hey? No, that ain’t the one I’m lookin’ fer.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re looking for or what you’re talking about—but
if you asked me if I had a mouth I’d make a guess at what you meant.”</p>
<p>“Come along to the house an’ hev some breakfast. Ye look all played out,
that’s a fact.”</p>
<p>“Now you’re talking English.”</p>
<p>Gaspard turned and led the way to the house. Akerley followed him into
the wide living-room. Breakfast was on the table; and between the stove
and the table stood Catherine, with a glow of conflicting excitements
and emotions in her eyes and on her cheeks.</p>
<p>“This here’s a young feller jist in time for a bite of breakfast,” said
Gaspard. “He ain’t a devil, nor he ain’t seen the devil. Don’t know his
name nor his business.”</p>
<p>“My name is Anderson,” said Akerley, with an apologetic smile at
Catherine.</p>
<p>“Good morning,” she replied, none too steadily.</p>
<p>They sat down at the table, and the old man made a long arm and speared
half a dozen pancakes from a central platter with his fork. Catherine
poured coffee.</p>
<p>“The young feller here says as how he see Ned Tone a ways back along the
road,” said Gaspard, spanking butter on the hot cakes.</p>
<p>The girl started and shot a quick glance of anxious inquiry at her
guest. Guessing the reason for her alarm, he smiled reassuringly at her.
They had not considered or guarded against that ghost of a chance of his
meeting anyone on the road.</p>
<p>“Is Ned Tone coming here?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I think not,” answered Akerley. “Not for a few days, anyway.”</p>
<p>“Why ain’t he comin’ here?” said Gaspard. “Not that he’s wanted—but he’s
comin’ all the same! Where else would he be on his way to but here?”</p>
<p>“He told me he wasn’t,” replied Akerley, pouring molasses on his cakes.
“He said he would stay where he was—where I met him—as long as his grub
hung out.”</p>
<p>His hearers did not make the slightest effort to hide their
astonishment.</p>
<p>“Ye’re crazy!” exclaimed the old man. “What’s the matter with him, that
he ain’t comin’ here? He’s been here often enough before, durn his pesky
hide!”</p>
<p>Akerley looked fairly into the girl’s eyes for a moment, then turned his
glance back to her grandfather.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t consider himself fit to be seen either here or back where he
came from,” he said. “He has a black eye, a cut cheek, a swollen ear, a
split lip and a skinned nose.”</p>
<p>“He run agin the devil, that’s sure!”</p>
<p>“You’re wrong. He started roughing it with me, when I was sitting as
quiet and polite as you please, smoking my pipe. He asked for it. But
for my hurt shoulder I’d have given him more than he asked for.”</p>
<p>“What’s that ye say? Walloped Ned Tone! Bested the heaviest hitter on
Injun River an’ split his lip! Stranger, I wisht it was true—but it
ain’t. It couldn’t be done by no one man as ever I see—leastwise not
since my own j’ints begun to stiffen. Young man, ye’re a liar.”</p>
<p>“Grandfather!” exclaimed Catherine.</p>
<p>“That’s as may be—but it is no lie when I tell you I pounded the pep out
of Ned Tone,” replied Akerley. “You can go and see for yourself. You’ll
find him at the edge of the road, about two miles from here.”</p>
<p>“That so? Reckon I’ll go take a look after I’ve et my breakfast. But
it’s that devil out o’ the sky I wanter see! I got what he needs an’
don’t want, young man—bullets nigh an inch long, in nickel jackets!”</p>
<p>The old man had a fine appetite; and he could do several things at the
same time. He could not only talk with his mouth full but he could quaff
coffee from his saucer in the same breath. He asked many questions. He
heard that his guest’s name was Tom Anderson, that Tom had come from
somewhere about the upper waters of the main river and lost his canoe
and outfit, and injured his left shoulder, on Indian River.</p>
<p>But Akerley did not tell his story gracefully, though it was to save his
life.</p>
<p>“Whereabouts on Injun River?” asked Gaspard.</p>
<p>“In white water, below a big pool and a fair-sized fall.”</p>
<p>“B’ilin’ Pot. An’ how’d ye git here?”</p>
<p>“I took a track ’round the pool and the falls and struck a road that led
me into the crease in the woods that brought me here.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t ye see no clearin’ nigh the Pot?”</p>
<p>“Maybe I did. What does it matter what I saw? I was heading for the tall
timber; and when Ned Tone overhauled me this morning I wasn’t more than
two miles from here. After our fight—after Tone woke up—he told me to
take the first turn off to the west and follow that track seven or eight
miles and I’d strike Gaspard Javet’s farm—but I guessed he was lying by
the look in his available eye, so I didn’t turn off to the west.”</p>

<p class='caption'>“‘HE WAS FIGGERIN’ TO LOSE YE IN THE WOODS.’”</p>
</div>
<p>“Did he tell you that?” cried the girl. “To go to the west—seven or
eight miles! And he saw that you hadn’t a rifle, or any food! And he
didn’t know that you knew better than to go to the west!”</p>
<p>“Knowed better!” exclaimed the old man, testily. “It wasn’t what he
knowed brought him here—it was the hand of Providence. That thar Ned
Tone’s a pore skunk! He was layin’ to lose ye in the woods; for ther
ain’t a house due west o’ this here within sixty mile, an’ all ye’d find
at the end o’ that loggin’ road is an empty shack that was built by Mick
Otter the Injun an’ me one year we cut out a bunch o’ pine timber. He
was figgerin’ to lose ye in the woods, the mean critter!”</p>
<p>“The coward!” exclaimed Catherine, pale with scorn.</p>
<p>Old Gaspard eyed her contemplatively for a moment. Akerley felt a
pleasant warmth at his heart.</p>
<p>“I’ll step along an’ take a look,” said Gaspard. “Ye kin stop right
here, young man, an’ rest up. I ain’t heared all about ye I wanter know
yet. Maybe ye’re a liar, fer all I know.”</p>
<p>“Liar or not, you’ll find me right here when you get back,” replied
Akerley.</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>Old Gaspard Javet was no more than out of the house before Akerley
commenced a detailed account of the morning’s adventure; and when that
was finished—and it was brief as it was vivid—the girl expressed her
delight at Ned Tone’s defeat. But she confessed her satisfaction was
somewhat chilled by apprehension of trouble of the bully’s making.
Akerley made light of her fears on that score.</p>
<p>“I am glad it happened just as it did,” he said. “He picked the fight.
I’m not worrying about him, so long as you are glad I did the beating.
And I don’t think he will talk about it, even after his lip heals.”</p>
<p>“The less he talks the more he will think,” she said. “He is stupid and
ignorant; and now we know he is bad—a murderer at heart. What brains he
has are inclined to craftiness and cunning. Hatred will stimulate
them—and he is sure to hate you for that thrashing.”</p>
<p>“I believe you. He has hopes of my starving in the woods. But hatred is
not the only sentiment I inspire in him. He is afraid of me.”</p>
<p>“Of course he is afraid of you. He will never stand up to you again in a
fair fight, if he can avoid it.”</p>
<p>“That is not all. Fear of my fists is not his greatest fear of me. He
would rather know me to be dead in the woods, by his lies, than know me
to be here. This came to me when your grandfather was talking. Now I am
beginning to understand things that I used to half see and
half-heartedly wonder at; and of course I have read about them in books,
as you have, too, I suppose. This has been an illuminating morning to
me.”</p>
<p>She looked at him inquiringly; and there was a shadow of embarrassment
in her eyes. She smiled and lowered her glance.</p>
<p>“When you talk like this I am certainly reminded of things I have read
in books,” she said. “But that is not enough intelligent conversation,
is it? What things do you mean?”</p>
<p>Akerley took pipe and tobacco from his pocket and regarded them fixedly
in the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>“I mean jealousy—and things like that,” he said, in a somewhat stuffy
voice. “Jealousy of one man for another—about a woman—and that sort of
ro—er—thing.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that sort of thing! Are you really ignorant of things like
that?—you, who have lived in the big world of men and women?”</p>
<p>Akerley glanced at her, then back at his pipe and tobacco. He produced a
knife and fell to slicing a pipeful.</p>
<p>“It is a fact,” he said. “Ever since I was a small boy I have had to
drive all my brains and energy at other things. I have been only an
onlooker at games of that sort, big and little; and as I didn’t know the
rules, and couldn’t guess them by looking, I wasn’t an interested
onlooker. But I have learned a great deal since I landed in this
clearing; and this very morning Ned Tone tried to lose me in the woods
simply to keep me away from here. Nothing like that ever happened to me
before.”</p>
<p>Catherine colored slightly.</p>
<p>“I wonder if you know anything of the horrors of loneliness,” she said
in a low voice.</p>
<p>“I have been lonely in cities and on crowded roads,” he replied; “and I
have been lonely in the air, sometimes with the old earth like a colored
map below me and flying blind in the fog, and with sunlit clouds under
me like fields and drifts of solid snow.”</p>
<p>“But you had your work,” she said; “and you were not always alone; and
in crowds you were always elbowed by strangers. I have never seen a
crowd of people. You have not known such loneliness as this—of endless
woods, and empty clearings, and winds lost in everlasting tree-tops, and
empty skies with only a speck of a hawk circling high up. You worked and
fought—but I had nothing to do. But for books I’d have gone mad, I
believe.”</p>
<p>“I can imagine it—but I wish you would tell me all about it.”</p>
<p>At that moment the expression of her eyes changed and she got quickly up
from the table.</p>
<p>“What if Grandfather tells Ned Tone about your arrival!” she exclaimed.
“About the devil he is looking for? Ned is from the settlements. He
often goes out to the towns on the main river. He would know it was an
aëroplane, and he would suspect the truth about you.”</p>
<p>“He may not mention it,” said Akerley; “so why go to meet trouble?”</p>
<p>Then he did a thing that astonished himself more than it seemed to
surprise Catherine. He stood up, stepped around the table and took her
passive right hand awkwardly in his.</p>
<p>“We have both read of this in books, and I have often seen it done on
the stage,” he said, in a wooden tone of voice; and he raised her hand,
bowed his head and touched his lips to the backs of her fingers.
Releasing her hand swiftly he turned, went out by the back door, took
two pails from the bench against the wall and started for the cow-yard.</p>
<p>The young woman ran after him and called from the porch that she and her
grandfather had already attended to the milking. He returned and
replaced the milk-pails.</p>
<p>“It is just as well,” he said. “I could only use one hand, anyway, for
that big rube caught me one smasher on my lame shoulder.”</p>
<p>She advised him to bathe the shoulder and put arnica on it. She gave him
the arnica along with the advice; and he accepted both. After that he
helped her with the work about the house; and then they sat on the porch
and she told him a great deal about her parentage and herself while they
awaited the reappearance of Gaspard Javet.</p>
<p>Catherine MacKim had been born twenty-one years ago, in this very house
in this clearing. She could not remember anything of her mother,
Gaspard’s daughter, for she had been left motherless at two years of
age; but her father, a son of the Crimean veteran, had often talked to
her about Catherine Javet, whom he had met and married, cherished and
buried in this wilderness. Hugh MacKim had been utterly lacking in
worldly ambition; and though not a weakling in mind or body, he had
possessed none of that particular blunt yet narrow variety of strength
by which thousands of men force themselves successfully through life. He
had been born in a big house in a prosperous farming district in
Ontario. His father, Major Ian MacKim, who had been awarded the Cross of
the Legion of Honor for his services before Sevastopol when an ensign in
an infantry regiment of the line, had moved to Canada soon after his
retirement from the active list of the army. Whatever the major may have
been when operating against the enemies of his King and Country, he had
proved himself an extraordinarily violent, stupid and difficult person
in civil life. As a farmer he had made himself an object of terror and
dislike to his neighbors and of fear and distress to his family. The
fact that he had contracted the causes of that bitter and unreasoning
temper while serving his country at the risk of his life excused it to
those of his connections and acquaintances who were so fortunate as
never to come into contact with it; but the truth is that rheumatism
from Russia and a liver whose action had been dulled and deranged in
India had made that valiant old soldier a terror to his own children.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances young Hugh MacKim, (who was later Catherine’s
father), had been glad to leave the farm and go to school in Montreal;
and when his school years had come to an end and he had been ordered to
return to the farm, he had taken to the woods instead. That life had
suited him. He had given up, without regret, most of the things to which
he had been born and bred; and of all that collection of inherited and
acquired tastes and habits, only his mild affection for books, his good
manners and his sense of fair play had survived. From one point and
another of the northern fringe of settlement he had written occasionally
to his mother.</p>
<p>After the major’s death the widow had sent the Cross of the Legion of
Honor to her strayed son Hugh, hoping that it might act as a spur to
hereditary pride and ambitions. It had pleased him mildly, that was all.
So the widow had turned to her younger son for an acknowledgment of
family and class responsibilities. Then Hugh had come into the Indian
River country, “cruising timber” for a big firm of Quebec operators; and
here he had discovered Gaspard Javet and his secluded clearings and his
beautiful daughter. Hugh had not gone farther. He had even neglected to
retrace his steps to Quebec and submit his report on the timber of the
lands which he had gone forth to explore. He had simply fallen in love
with Catherine Javet and thrown in his lot with her father.</p>
<p>Hugh MacKim had known happiness and contentment in his height-of-land
for seven years—until his wife’s death; and after that—after time had
dulled the cutting edge of his loneliness for her—he had known
contentment for the remaining years of his life. His appetite for the
woods, and for those dexterities of hand and eye which life in the
wilderness called for, had never failed him. He had been a poet in his
appreciation of nature. His eye for the weather had never been as
knowing as Gaspard’s, but always more loving. He had always seen more in
dawns and sunsets than promises of rain or wind or frost. And his had
been the knowledge and skill, but never the ruthlessness, of a
first-rate trapper and hunter. He had delighted in the companionship of
his father-in-law from the first; and admiration and affection had been
mutual in the friendship of those two. His love for his daughter had
been tender and unfaltering. He had taught her the delight of books and
of the life around her. He had taught her to read two languages from
printed pages and the hundred tongues and signs of wood, water and sky.
He had died two winters ago.</p>
<p>“I should like to have known your father,” said Akerley. “I believe he
was right about himself, his own life—but didn’t he ever look ahead? Did
he picture you here in the woods always?”</p>
<p>“There was no place in the big world for him,” she replied. “We belonged
to these woods, he and I; and, of course, he did not know that he was to
die so soon. His health was good. He was ill only a few days.”</p>
<p>“Part of his brain must have been asleep,” said Akerley. “He thought of
you always as a child, I suppose. All this would be well enough if you
never grew up; but you are grown up already. And your grandfather cannot
live for ever. He is queer, anyway—with this crazy idea in his head
about devils.”</p>
<p>“Here he is,” said Catherine.</p>
<p>Gaspard Javet stepped out onto the back porch and stood his rifle
against the wall. He sat down and reflectively combed his beard with
long fingers crooked with the toil of the woods. Then he looked at
Akerley with a new interest, new curiosity and a distinct light of
kindliness in his gray eyes.</p>
<p>“I found Ned Tone,” he said. “He tol’ me how he’d had a fight with a
b’ar—an’ he looked it. I didn’t gainsay him.”</p>
<p>“Did you tell him anything, Grandad?” asked Catherine.</p>
<p>“Yes, I told ’im how I’d like fine to see the b’ar.”</p>
<p>“Nothin’ about the devil, Grandad?”</p>
<p>“Not me—to be laughed at fer an old fool by them fat-heads down round
B’ilin’ Pot.”</p>
<p>“Did you ask him why he told this gentleman to go to the westward to
find these clearings?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t tell ’im nothin’ about what doesn’t consarn ’im. If he wants
to know what’s happened to this young feller he kin take the old road to
the west an’ try to find out.”</p>
<p>“I think you are very clever and wise, Grandad,” said the girl; and she
glanced at Akerley with relief in her eyes.</p>
<p>Akerley felt relief, too. The heavy hitter was off his trail for the
moment, at least. But something else worried him.</p>
<p>“About that devil,” he said, turning to Gaspard. “What makes you think
it was a devil?”</p>
<p>“I heared it miles an’ miles away,” replied the old man, “It was a
devilish sound, hummin’ all ’round in the dark. It was foretold to me
long ago in a dream—how I’d be beset by a devil, an’ how I’d best ’im if
I kep’ my eyes skinned an’ my gun handy. I ain’t afeared of ’im—but I
was at first. I hid in the woods; but pretty soon that old dream come
back to me about how a devil would beset me one day fer the cussin’,
unbelievin’ ways o’ my youth, but how I’d surely git ’im in time if I
kep’ after ’im.”</p>
<p>“What would you do if you found him?” asked Akerley.</p>
<p>The old man twitched a thumb toward the rifle against the wall.</p>
<p>“But if he’s a devil you couldn’t hurt him with a bullet.”</p>
<p>“Ye’re wrong. In my dream I shot ’im dead as pork. And now that I’ve
told you all about that devil, young man, I’d like to hear more about
yerself.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever heard of men flying in the air?”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed Gaspard, with a swift change of voice and a
queer, dangerous gleam in his gray eyes. “Men flyin’? No, I ain’t! Nor I
don’t want to. Devils may go disguised, in lonely places as well as in
towns, fer to dig pit-falls fer the feet of men. But men can’t fly!”</p>
<p>Catherine gave the intruder a warning glance.</p>
<p>Akerley sighed and told a story of his past—a very patchy one—along the
lines which he had planned while lying awake in the barn the night
before. But his heart was not in it. He felt that the old woodsman was
doing him an injustice and an injury in believing in flying devils and
at the same time refusing to believe in flying men. He felt that, but
for this crazy kink in Gaspard’s brain, he could safely be as frank with
him as he had been with Catherine—for he saw the qualities of kindness
and understanding in the old man. But he had to invent a silly story as
he valued his life.</p>
<p>He was from the big river, he said: but he had lived in towns sometimes
and even gone to school. He had made his living in the woods of late
years in lumber-camps and on the “drives” and that sort of thing. He had
trapped for one winter, without much success; and he had taken city
sportsmen up-country several times, for fishing in summer and to hunt
moose and deer in the fall. He was not a registered guide, and he had
not kept to any one part of the country for long at a time.</p>
<p>“What started ye fer Injun River?” asked Gaspard.</p>
<p>“I had to start for somewhere, and quick at that,” replied Akerley.</p>
<p>“Had to, hey? Chased out?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t wait to see if I was chased. I had plenty of gas, as it
happened, and—”</p>
<p>“Hey?”</p>
<p>“Grub. I shifted my ground quick and stepped light so’s not to leave any
tracks in the mud. My canoe was ready.”</p>
<p>“I reckon ye mean that the Law’s on yer tracks,” said Gaspard, eyeing
him keenly. “Ye don’t look like a law-breaker to me—onless maybe it was
a game-law ye busted.”</p>
<p>“Anything you prefer.”</p>
<p>“Well, some game-laws have hoss-sense an’ reason to ’em and others
ain’t.”</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t kill deer or moose or caribou out of season,” said
Catherine, looking intently at the intruder. “But I wouldn’t think the
worse of anyone who took a salmon out of a rented pool, as Mick Otter
did on Indian River.”</p>
<p>There was something in her glance that caused Akerley to sit up and use
his brains quick.</p>
<p>“I am glad you feel that way,” he said, quite briskly.</p>
<p>He remembered an actual incident of a trip he had made into the wilds
years ago.</p>
<p>“I dipped into a pool with a spear that was given me by an old Indian,”
he continued. “I got a fine fish—twenty-four pounds. You should have
seen him come up like a ghost through the black water to the light of
the birch-bark torch. Great sport—but it isn’t inside the law
now-a-days.”</p>
<p>“Ye’re right!” exclaimed old Gaspard Javet. “I ain’t speared a salmon in
thirty years—but I reckon I’ve done worse.”</p>
<p>“So here I am—with a frying-pan and an old quilt,” said Akerley.</p>
<p>“Thar’s grub enough fer ye here, an’ work too,” said Gaspard. “Grub an’
work, an’ blankets to sleep in—which is enough fer any sensible man.
Ye’re welcome to all three fer as long as it suits ye, fer I like yer
looks.”</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>The newspapers had a great deal to say about the extraordinary behavior
and mysterious disappearance of Major T. V. Akerley, M. C., of the Royal
Air Force. Why had he hit Lieutenant-Colonel E. F. Nasher on the point
of the chin? That was the question; and no one seemed to be so ignorant
of the answer as Colonel Nasher himself. Many young men who possessed
pens of ready writers (more or less) and little else dealt lengthily
with the problem.</p>
<p>The Press soon came to the conclusion that the major had hit the colonel
out of pure cussedness—that a young and distinguished officer had
committed assault and battery; insubordination with violence; behavior
unbecoming an officer and a gentleman; and desertion coupled with theft
of Government property, all in an outburst of causeless and unreasoning
temper.</p>
<p>Then military men, demobilized and otherwise, of various arms of the
Service and various ranks, began dipping unaccustomed pens on the
vanished Akerley’s behalf. One wrote, “I was Major Akerley’s groom when
he was a cavalry lieutenant. He was the quietest officer I ever knew.
Some of our officers ...; but that Mr. Akerley didn’t even get mad, so’s
you’d notice when his batman burnt his boots he’d paid seven guineas for
in London. I guess Major Akerley had a reason for doing what he did.”</p>
<p>Many other warriors wrote in the same vein, among them a retired
major-general. Much was written of Akerley’s reserve of manner, devotion
to duty, skill as an airman and cool courage as a fighter. All these
champions had known Akerley in France, of course; and all denied any
personal knowledge of Colonel Nasher, whose military activities had not
carried him beyond Ottawa.</p>
<p>The result of all this literary effort on the part of the veterans was a
very general sympathy, strong and wide-spread, for the run-away Ace—but
as neither newspapers nor the faintest echoes of public opinion reach
Gaspard’s clearings, Akerley knew nothing of it. The civil and military
police continued to scratch their heads, and run finger-tips (not
entirely free from splinters) across and around maps of the world, and
submit reports to their respective headquarters through the proper
channels, with a view to the disciplining and undoing of Major Akerley
and the recovery of the aëroplane.</p>
<p>Tom Akerley, known to old Gaspard as Tom Anderson, lived his new life
from day to day and tried not to worry. His shoulder mended rapidly, and
he worked about the farm with a will. He spent much of his time in
Gaspard’s company, working in the crops, mending fences and clearing
stones from the fields; and the fact that the old man’s rifle always lay
or stood near at hand at once amused and irritated him.</p>
<p>Gaspard continued to cling to his belief that he had been visited by a
devil, a fiend of darkness out of the night, and that the visitor was
still somewhere in the vicinity; and sometimes Tom joined him on these
fruitless hunts for the intruder through the surrounding forests. On
these occasions, Tom was armed with a muzzle-loading, double-barrelled
gun, the left barrel rammed with a bullet and the right with duck-shot.</p>
<p>“Would you know him if you saw him?” asked Tom during one of these
expeditions, as they rested after a stumbling struggle through an alder
swamp.</p>
<p>“He’d be discovered to me quick as the flash of an eye,” replied the old
man. “Fer years have I bin expectin’ him, in punishment for the reckless
ways o’ my youth; an’ I’ll know ’im when I set eyes on ’im, ye kin lay
to that!”</p>
<p>“And then what will you do?” asked Tom.</p>
<p>“Pump it to ’im! Pump it into ’im!” exclaimed the old man, heartily; and
he illustrated his pleasant intention by crooking and wiggling the
trigger-finger of his right hand.</p>
<p>Even the knowledge of the fact that the cartridges in the rifle were
harmless failed to put Tom entirely at his ease.</p>
<p>Tom enjoyed the evenings and rainy days. Then he read or played chess
with Catherine or listened to Gaspard’s stories of the past. The old man
told some stirring tales of his physical prowess; and always at the
conclusion of such narratives he would say, in a fallen voice, “Vanity,
vanity, all sich things is vanity.”</p>
<p>The grass ripened for the scythe; and Tom drew Gaspard’s attention to
the fact.</p>
<p>“Mick would feel reel put out if we started hayin’ before he got here,”
said Gaspard. “He ain’t missed a hayin’ in twenty year, Mick Otter
ain’t.”</p>
<p>“Where does he live?” asked Tom.</p>
<p>“Everywheres,” replied the old man. “Mostly crost the height-o’-land, I
reckon. He can’t keep still fer long, that Injun. Soon as the ice busts
up he’s off, runnin’ the woods till the grass is ripe. He lights out
agin after harvest, an’ lives on the gun till the snow lays a foot deep
over these clearin’s. He’ll be here inside the week, to mow the first
swath—onless somethin’s happened to ’im.”</p>
<p>They took down the scythes next morning, and Tom turned the grindstone
while Gaspard ground the long blades. They were intent on their task in
the sunshine when a shadow fell suddenly upon the stone. Tom glanced up
and saw a squat figure standing within a few feet of him. He ceased to
turn the stone and straightened his back. Old Gaspard poured water from
a rusty tin along the edge of the blade, tested its keenness with a
thumb and said, “How do, Mick.”</p>
<p>“How do,” replied the old Maliseet. “You start hayin’, what?”</p>
<p>“Reckoned ye’d be along in time to cut the first swath,” returned
Gaspard.</p>
<p>Mick Otter nodded his head and looked at Tom. His eyes were round and
dark and very bright. He stared unwinking for several seconds, then
turned again to Gaspard.</p>
<p>“You got young man for Catherine, what?” he said.</p>
<p>Gaspard smiled.</p>
<p>“That’s as may be,” he replied. “Ask Catherine herself, if ye wanter
know. Howsumever, this here’s Tom Anderson, from ’way over on the upper
St. John. He speared a salmon an’ the wardens chased ’im out.”</p>
<p>“That so?” said Mick Otter. “Chase ’im quite a ways, what?”</p>
<p>Tom laughed goodnaturedly.</p>
<p>The three went into the house, where Catherine welcomed Mick Otter
cordially and produced a second breakfast. The Maliseet ate swiftly,
heartily and in silence, nodding or shaking his head now and then in
answer to a question. Then the three men returned to the scythes and the
grindstone. Fifteen minutes later they were mowing in the oldest and
ripest meadow. Mick Otter led along the edge of the field; old Gaspard
followed and Tom brought up the rear. Tom had learned to swing a scythe
when a small boy. Like swimming and milking, it is a knack not easily
forgotten. Catherine came out and sat on the fence. Mick Otter left his
place and walked over to her, wiped his long blade with a handful of
grass and then played on it with his ringing scythe-stone. Returning the
stone to his hip-pocket, he said, “How that young feller come here,
anyhow?”</p>
<p>“Why, how would he come?” returned the girl, “not in a canoe, that’s
certain; and he didn’t bring a horse.”</p>
<p>“Maybe he walk here, hey?”</p>
<p>“That seems reasonable, Mick.”</p>
<p>“An’ maybe he don’t walk, what?”</p>
<p>Catherine glanced over to assure herself that her grandfather was out of
ear-shot, then descended from her perch on the top rail and stepped
close to the old Maliseet.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, Mick Otter?” she asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>“That young feller no guide nor lumberman,” said Mick. “Big man, him.
See his picter in the paper, all dress up like soldier.”</p>
<p>While he spoke his round, bright eyes searched her eyes.</p>
<p>“Keep quiet,” she whispered. “Grandad doesn’t know—nobody knows. I’ll
tell you first chance I get. You are my friend, Mick. You’ll keep quiet,
won’t you? Grandad thinks it was a devil—and he is always hunting around
with his rifle.”</p>
<p>“That a’ right,” said the Indian; and he returned to his work.</p>
<p>Catherine soon found an opportunity for speech with Akerley. She told
him of her conversation with Mick Otter.</p>
<p>“I am not afraid of him,” she continued. “He is kind and sane: He will
keep your secret, if we are perfectly frank with him. I am afraid of the
newspapers. A mail comes in once a fortnight to Millbrow, and that is
only ten miles below Boiling Pot; and perhaps Ned Tone has already seen
a paper with your photograph and story in it.”</p>
<p>Tom’s face paled for an instant.</p>
<p>“Please don’t think that I am afraid of Ned Tone,” he said. “I am only
afraid of being driven away from here. But perhaps there is no real
danger of it. That fellow’s eyes may not be as sharp as Mick Otter’s. If
the old Indian is to be trusted I’ll just carry on and let Ned Tone make
the next move; but I think he would have been nosing around before this,
if he had recognized my phiz in a newspaper.”</p>
<p>“But he does not know you are here,” said the girl. “He has every reason
to believe that you are lost in the woods, wandering about eating wild
berries—or dead.”</p>
<p>When old Mick Otter heard Tom Akerley’s story from Catherine, he
permitted himself the faintest flicker of a smile. The thing that
tickled his sense of humor was the position of his old friend Gaspard
Javet.</p>
<p>“Gaspar’ he hate devil darn bad an’ like Tom darn well, what?” he
remarked. “We bes’ fix them catridges again before Gaspar’ shoot at deer
or bobcat, or maybe he smell somethin’, hey?”</p>
<p>“But what shall we do if Ned Tone sees a newspaper and suspects the
truth about Tom?” asked Catherine.</p>
<p>“How you know that until he come, hey? He don’t git no newspaper, maybe,
down to B’ilin’ Pot. We watch out sharp, anyhow; an’ if Ned Tone make
the move, me an’ Tom take to the big woods; an’ nobody find ’im then,
you bet. Ned Tone got nothin’ in his skull ’cept some muscle off his
neck.”</p>
<p>With this the girl had to be satisfied, but she believed that both Tom
and the old Maliseet under-rated Ned Tone’s cunning and the possible
danger which he represented.</p>
<p>The weather held fine and the hay-making went briskly on day by day; and
in odd half-hours, usually late at night, Mick and Tom worked at
replacing the explosive charges in Gaspard’s cartridges. Catherine
helped in this, by carrying and returning, as she had helped Tom in the
work of withdrawing the same charges of cordite. She and Tom felt no
fear now of the old man’s recognizing Tom as the being that had swooped
down from the sky; and Tom felt so sure now of Gaspard’s friendship and
sanity that, but for the girl, he would have confessed the facts of the
case to him. She would not hear of this, however.</p>
<p>“You don’t know him as well as I do,” she argued. “He is a dear, kind
old man—but he is quite mad on that one subject of a visit from a devil.
But, of course, if you want to be shot dead, if you are tired of life in
this dull place, tell Grandad.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll not tell him—for I was never more interested in life than I
am now,” said Tom, gravely.</p>
<p>Soon all the grass was cut, cured and housed, except that in the “new
clearin’.” This piece of land was actually four, five and six years old
as a clearing. Though not more than four acres in extent it represented
three seasons’ brushing and burning. Old Gaspard Javet had cleared every
rod of it single-handed. Each spring, as soon as the ground was dry, he
had set to work, cutting out the brush and smaller growth at the roots
but leaving waist-high stumps in the felling of the larger timber. Then,
having trimmed and twitched out the stuff for fence-rails and firewood,
he had piled the brush and branches and set fire to them, piled them
again and burned them again, then scattered his oats and grass-seed and
harrowed them into the ashes among the scorched stumps. Thus he had
taken a crop of grain, or a crop of fodder if the frosts fell early,
from each patch of new land in the first year, and harvests of hay in
the following years. Now the whole clearing stood thick with long spears
of timothy grass that topped the gray and black stumps.</p>
<p>The new clearing lay north of the older fields and was separated from
them by a belt of woods several hundred yards wide.</p>
<p>Tom cut into the ripe timothy early one morning, while Gaspard Javet and
Mick Otter were still engaged in an argument concerning the relative
merits of several methods of trapping mink. He cut along the northern
edge of the field—a wavering swath, owing to obtrusive stumps. He was
about to return to the starting-point when the excited barking of
Blackie, the little dog of obscure antecedents, attracted his attention.
There was a serious, threatening note in Blackie’s outcry that was new
to it—a tone that Tom had never heard when chipmunks, or even
porcupines, were the cause of the excitement.</p>
<p>“He has found something interesting,” said Tom, and he immediately
balanced the scythe on the top of a stump, vaulted the brush-fence and
made for the sound through the thick undergrowth of young spruces. The
dog continued to bark; and suddenly Tom realized that he was moving to
the right in full cry. So he quickened his own pace and shouted to the
dog as he ran. Then he heard the crashing of a heavy body through the
thickets, receding swiftly; and Blackie’s angry yelps, also receding,
took on a breathless note. He ran at top speed for several hundred
yards, avoiding the trunks of trees but setting his feet down blindly,
until a sprawled root tripped him and laid him flat on the moss. He sat
up as soon as he had recovered his breath.</p>
<p>“It didn’t sound like a deer,” he reflected. “It wasn’t jumping. The pup
doesn’t pay any attention to deer. It may have been a bear or a
moose—though I can’t quite imagine either of them running away from that
pup.”</p>
<p>He got to his feet and spent a few minutes in searching around for
tracks in the moss. Though rain had fallen during the night, he failed
to discover any marks of hoof or claw. So he returned to the clearing;
and there he found Gaspard and Mick.</p>
<p>“What you bin chasin’, hey?” asked the Maliseet.</p>
<p>Tom told them. Mick immediately discarded his scythe and scrambled
through the fence. Old Gaspard Javet grinned and stroked his white
whiskers.</p>
<p>“There goes that durned Injun, fer a run in the woods,” he said, with an
expression of face and voice as if he were speaking of a beloved infant.
“He’s the everlastin’est wild-goose chaser I ever see. He’d foller a
shadder, Mick would—aye, foller its tracks, an’ overhaul it, too—an’
maybe try to skin it. But he’s more for the chase nor the kill, Mick
is—more for the hunt nor the skin. He’s what Cathie’s pa uster call a
good sportsman, I reckon—that gad-about old Injun.”</p>
<p>Then he swung his scythe with a dry swish through the stems of tall
timothy and a thousand purple-powdered heads bowed down before him.</p>
<p>Gaspard and Tom moved steadily among the stumps for about half an hour;
and then Mick Otter scrambled back through the fence with the little dog
panting at his heels.</p>
<p>“That b’ar got boots on, anyhow,” said Mick.</p>
<p>“Boots, d’ye say?” exclaimed Gaspard. “Boots!—an’ spyin’ ’round like a
wild critter instead of walkin’ up to the house an’ namin’ his business
like a Christian. I reckon I best take a look at him an’ his boots.”</p>
<p>He laid aside the scythe and took up his ever-handy rifle.</p>
<p>“You think him devil, what?” said Mick.</p>
<p>“Ye can’t never tell,” returned Gaspard, climbing the barrier of brush
that shut the forest from the clearing.</p>
<p>Mick Otter and the little dog followed. Tom checked his own impulse to
go rambling in the cool woods, filled and lit his pipe and returned to
the mowing. He had not gone half the length of the field before
Catherine came running to him, straight through the standing crop.</p>
<p>“Ned Tone is at the house,” she said, breathlessly; and then, “Where are
the others?” she asked.</p>
<p>Tom told her of the morning’s excitement.</p>
<p>“That was Ned Tone,” she said. “He had been running, I know. You didn’t
see him; and I am sure he didn’t see you, by the questions he asked. But
he wouldn’t have come spying like that if he didn’t think there was a
chance of your being here.”</p>
<p>“Do you suppose he has seen a paper and suspects something?” asked Tom.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I couldn’t see anything in his manner to suggest it. He
was just as he always is—except that he asked if I had seen anything of
a stranger recently.”</p>
<p>“Where is he now?”</p>
<p>“Sitting on the porch. I told him to wait there—that I would soon be
back.”</p>
<p>“And he didn’t wait!” exclaimed Tom. “He came sneaking after you.”</p>
<p>He stepped past the girl and ran forward through the tall grass.</p>
<p>“I see you,” he shouted as he ran. “What are you prying ’round here for?
Stand up and show yourself.”</p>
<p>Ned Tone advanced reluctantly from the belt of forest that separated the
old clearings from the new, with an air of embarrassment and anger. Tom
walked aggressively up to him, halting within a yard of him. They were
in plain sight of Catherine.</p>
<p>“So it’s you!” exclaimed Tom. “Were you looking for me?”</p>
<p>“Nope, I wasn’t,” said Tone. “Who be ye, anyhow?”</p>
<p>“I’m the man who didn’t take the track to the left, as you know very
well,” replied Tom, smiling dangerously. “Your face looks better than it
did when I last saw you. Your lip has healed quite nicely.”</p>
<p>“’S that so! Mind yer own business, will ye? Have I got to ask yer leave
to come to Gaspard Javet’s clearin’s?”</p>
<p>“Certainly not—but I thought you didn’t know the way. You told me that
Gaspard’s place lay to the west. What were you spying ’round here for,
half an hour ago?”</p>
<p>Tom jerked a thumb toward the northern edge of the field.</p>
<p>“What of it?” retorted the other. “I go where I choose. I was here afore
ye ever come an’ I’ll be here still, after ye’re gone. I don’t step
outer my tracks fer every tramp an’ thief that runs the woods. Don’t
think ye own this country jist because the game-wardens chased ye away
from where ye belong.”</p>
<p>“What do you know about the game-wardens?” asked Tom, in surprise,
wondering where the fellow had heard the yarn which he had been forced
to tell to old Gaspard Javet.</p>
<p>“I ain’t a fool,” returned Ned Tone, with a knowing leer. “What else
would ye’ve come into this country for? But if ye don’t clear out, I’ll
put old Gaspard wise to ye; an’ he’ll run ye outer these woods.”</p>
<p>Tom laughed cheerfully; and Catherine heard it and caught the note of
relief in it.</p>
<p>“Gaspard is hunting you with his rifle this very minute,” he said. “He
and Mick Otter are on your tracks.”</p>
<p>“Huntin’ me!” exclaimed Tone. “Me an’ this family is old friends.”</p>
<p>Catherine MacKim joined them at that moment.</p>
<p>“You are not a friend of ours, Ned Tone,” she said, looking him straight
in the eyes. “Grandad and I don’t have cowards and liars for friends.”</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>Ned Tone flinched and reddened at the insult.</p>
<p>“That ain’t no way to talk to me!” he cried. “You wouldn’t dare say it
if ye was a man.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I would. You showed yourself in your true colors when you
misdirected this stranger. That was the lowest, meanest trick ever
played in these woods by white man or Indian.”</p>
<p>“’S that so. Maybe <i>he’s</i> the liar. Who is he, anyhow, an’ what’s he
hidin’ ’round here for? Where’d he come from? He’s a slick talker; an’ I
reckon that’s all ye know about him, Catherine MacKim.”</p>
<p>“We’ll just step back into the woods, you and I, out of the lady’s sight
and hearing, if she’ll excuse us for a few minutes,” said Tom, in a
quiet voice.</p>
<p>“Not me,” replied the big woodsman. “I got nothin’ to say to ye in
private. If ye’re lookin’ fer a fight ye’re lookin’ up the wrong tree, I
wouldn’t dirty my hands on ye.”</p>
<p>“Again, you mean.”</p>
<p>“So ye’ve bin braggin’ about that, have ye?”</p>
<p>“Well, it was something to brag about, don’t you think so?—to beat up
the heaviest hitter on Indian River? Gaspard Javet wouldn’t believe it
possible until he saw you—and you told him you’d had a scrap with a
bear.”</p>
<p>“It ain’t true,” snarled Tone. “It’s all lies. My word’s as good as
yourn—an’ better. I won’t fight, anyhow.”</p>
<p>“In that case, please go away from here immediately!” exclaimed
Catherine.</p>
<p>Her voice shook and her face was pale with anger and scorn.</p>
<p>“D’ye mean that?” cried Tone. “Order me off like a dog, without bite or
sup, because I won’t fight with this here tramp? An’ me a neighbor from
B’ilin’ Pot! Treat me worse’n ye’d treat a drunk Injun! That ain’t the
way we do things in this country, Catherine MacKim. We don’t turn agin
our neighbors jist to please slick-spoken hoboes a-sneakin’ ’round
tryin’ to shake the game-wardens. Like enough there’s more nor
game-wardens after this smart Alec—the police theirselves, like as not.”</p>
<p>“I wonder why you stand there talking when no one wants to listen to
you,” said the girl.</p>
<p>Tone received those quiet words as if he had been struck in the face. He
had been amazed and angered before—but the amazement and anger which he
now felt were beyond anything of the sort he had ever known or even
imagined. His eyes darkened with the dangerous shadows of outraged
vanity and goaded fury. So he stared at her for a few seconds; and then,
quick as a flash, he turned and flung himself upon Tom Akerley.</p>
<p>Tom, who had not seen the change in the other’s eyes, was not ready for
the onslaught. Over he went, flat on his back in the long grass, with
the big bushwhacker on top of him; and so he lay—for a fraction of a
second.</p>
<p>Ned Tone’s fingers were on Tom’s windpipe, and one of his knees was on
the chest and the other in the pit of the stomach of the prostrate one,
when Tom suddenly turned over on his face and humped himself like a
camel. Tone felt a grip as of iron on both wrists, a cracking strain on
the muscles of his arms and shoulders, and then a sense of general
upheaval. His feet described an arc in the air and he struck the ground
full-length with jarring force.</p>
<p>Tone got up slowly and saw Tom standing beside Catherine.</p>
<p>“You don’t know any more about wrestling than you do about boxing,” said
Tom, pleasantly. “But even if you were trained you wouldn’t be much
good, for all your weight and muscle—because you haven’t any spirit, any
grit.”</p>
<p>Tone turned without a word and started slowly for the road that cut
through the belt of forest and connected the new clearing with the older
fields. The others followed him, Tom smiling and the girl still pale
with indignation and scorn. Tone did not look around. As he passed close
to the house, on his way to the road that led afar through the
wilderness to Boiling Pot, Tom overtook him and suggested that he should
rest awhile and have something to eat. Tone’s reply to the offer of
hospitality would scorch the paper if written down. So Tom let him go.
Tone turned at the edge of the woods and shook his fist.</p>
<p>Tom turned to Catherine, who had come up and halted beside him, and
said, “He is so futile that I feel sorry for him.”</p>
<p>“He would be dangerous if he knew—but it is quite evident that he
doesn’t know,” she said. “But he’ll do you some injury if he possibly
can. I think he hates you. I am afraid I would not have let him off so
easily if I had been in your place to-day, after that treacherous
attack.”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t seem to like me, that’s a fact,” returned Tom, with a quiet
smile. “I suppose it is natural that he should feel that way about me,
for several reasons; and I am not sorry.”</p>
<p>Catherine glanced at him quickly, and the color was back in her cheeks.</p>
<p>“You are wonderfully good-natured,” she said, “and you seem to have a
marvelous control of your temper. I can’t understand your striking that
colonel.”</p>
<p>“My nerves are better than they were then,” he replied. “But even
now—well, when it comes to a fellow like that saying that your dead
friend was a coward!—but he was fat and out of condition, and I
shouldn’t have hit him on the chin.”</p>
<p>“I am not finding fault with you for that,” she said. “Far from it.”</p>
<p>She entered the house, and Tom returned to his mowing in the new
clearing. As he took up his scythe he muttered, “I wonder what’s going
to happen to me here—and when?”</p>
<p>Gaspard and Mick Otter were late for dinner, but they found Catherine
and Tom waiting at the table for them. After hearing all about Ned
Tone’s visit, Gaspard used threatening language. Mick Otter plied his
knife with a preoccupied air.</p>
<p>“You don’t like him, hey?” he queried, looking at Gaspard.</p>
<p>“No, or never did, durn his hide!” exclaimed the other.</p>
<p>“Guess he feels sore,” said the Maliseet, looking reflectively at
Catherine. “You like ’im one time maybe, hey Cathie?”</p>
<p>“Never!” cried the girl. “I never liked him!”</p>
<p>Mick wagged his head and glanced at Tom.</p>
<p>“You best watch out or maybe he shoot you from b’ind a tree one day,” he
said.</p>
<p>The hay was all cut and gathered in; the oats and buckwheat were
harvested; the potatoes were dug and stored; and still old Mick Otter
stuck to the clearings and the hard work, and in all that time nothing
more was seen or heard of Ned Tone from Boiling Pot. Gaspard Javet
continued to keep his rifle handy, but whether in readiness for a snap
at the fiendish visitor or at the heaviest hitter on Indian River the
others were not sure.</p>
<p>Mid-September came, with nights of white frost, mornings of gold and
silver magic, and noons of sunshine faintly fragrant with scents of
balsamy purple cones and frost-nipped berries and withering ferns. Red
and yellow leaves fell circling in windless coverts; and cock
partridges, with trailing wings and out-fanned tails, mounted on
prostrate trunks of old gray pines, filled the afternoons with their
hollow drumming. Then a change came over Mick Otter. His interest in
agricultural pursuits suddenly expired. Fat pigs, well-fed cattle, full
barns and his comfortable bed suddenly lost all meaning for him. He
sniffed the air; and his eyes were always lifting from his work to the
hazy edges of the forest. Even the virtues of Catherine’s cooking
suddenly seemed a small and unimportant matter to him.</p>
<p>One evening at supper he said, “Set little line o’ traps ’round Pappoose
Lake maybe. Plenty musquash, some fox, some mink, maybe. You don’t trap
that country long time now, hey?”</p>
<p>“Ain’t trapped it these five years,” replied Gaspard. “I’d help ye set
the line but I be afeared o’ rheumatics—an’ I gotter watch out ’round
these here clearin’s.”</p>
<p>“You come, hey?” queried Mick, turning to Tom. “Git plenty fur, plenty
money, plenty sport.”</p>
<p>“Where is it?” asked Tom, without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Five-six mile,” replied Mick. “You come back when you like to see
Gaspar’, what?”</p>
<p>Tom reflected that money might be useful in the future, although he had
lived through these last three months without a cent. He could see no
likelihood of ever being able to touch the few hundreds of dollars to
his credit in the bank, in the distant world from which he had fled.
Yes, he might need money some day; and furs of almost every variety
brought a high price now, he had heard. So why not join Mick Otter in
this venture? If their activities took them no farther afield than
Pappoose Lake he would be able to visit the clearing twice or thrice a
week—and oftener, with luck. He glanced covertly at Catherine.</p>
<p>Catherine had been watching him; and the moment their eyes met, she
nodded slightly and smiled.</p>
<p>“That a’ right!” exclaimed Mick Otter, whose sharp eyes and active wits
had missed nothing.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll go with you,” said Tom, with an embarrassed grin. “But I warn
you that I don’t know anything about trapping fur.”</p>
<p>“That a’ right,” returned the Maliseet. “Mick Otter got the brain for
the both of us, you got the arm an’ the leg for the hard work. Take
plenty fur, you bet.”</p>
<p>They set out for Pappoose Lake, six miles to the northward, two days
later. They carried blankets, axes, Mick Otter’s rifle, a small bag of
flour, tea, bacon, a kettle, a frying-pan and half a dozen traps. It
took them three hours to get to the lake, for the way was rough and not
straight and their loads were heavy. There Tom rested for half an hour;
and Mick cruised around for a likely site for their camp. Then Tom
returned to the clearings, dined with Gaspard and Catherine, loaded up
with more provisions, four more traps and a tarpaulin, and headed
northward again for Pappoose Lake.</p>
<p>Catherine followed him from the house, and called to him just as he was
climbing the brush-fence at the northern edge of the new clearing. He
turned very willingly and lowered his pack to the ground.</p>
<p>“I have just thought of something,” she said. “Ned Tone is still
dangerous, and we should be ready for him if he comes back. The danger
of his seeing something, or hearing something, to cause him to suspect
your identity, isn’t passed, you know.”</p>
<p>“I know it,” said Tom. “I realize that I am still in danger of
discovery. That is the only thing that worries me now.”</p>
<p>“And if you are found, it will be through Ned Tone,” she said. “You must
be careful. Whenever you come back, take a look at the house before you
show yourself. If there is danger I’ll show something white in my
window.”</p>
<p>“And at night?”</p>
<p>“A candle on my window-sill. But that is not all. If the danger seems
acute, if there is a chance of people searching the woods for you, I’ll
come and warn you.”</p>
<p>“But do you know the way?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have been to Pappoose Lake.”</p>
<p>Tom thanked her somewhat awkwardly for her thoughtfulness, hoisted his
lumpy pack to his shoulders again and scrambled slowly across the
brush-fence. He turned on the other side.</p>
<p>“Perhaps I’ll be able to tell you—to show you, some day—to prove to
you—what I think of your kindness—and you,” he said.</p>
<p>Then he turned and vanished in the underbrush; and the girl turned and
went back to the house, thoughtful but happy.</p>
<p>Mick Otter and Tom made two camps, one on the western end of Pappoose
Lake and the other seven miles away to the northwest, on Racquet Pond.
The first was nothing more than a lean-to, walled with woven brush and
roofed with the tarpaulin. The second was built of poles chinked with
moss—four walls broken by a doorway and a tiny window-hole. In the
middle of the mossy floor lay a circular hearth of stones; and directly
above the hearth, in the sloping roof of poles and sods, gaped a square
hole.</p>
<p>Mick Otter was proud of the Racquet Pond camp—but Tom didn’t think very
highly of it. Having completed the camps to the old Maliseet’s entire
satisfaction, they set the lines of traps—five traps in the vicinity of
Pappoose Lake and five around Racquet Pond. For three weeks they made
the lean-to their headquarters; and in that time Tom made half a dozen
visits to Gaspard Javet’s farm; finding that everything was right there
and that nothing more had been seen or heard of Ned Tone.</p>
<p>The last week of October was one of miserable weather. A heavy frost had
frozen the swamps and driven the woodcock south; and this was followed
by days of chilly rain—rain so exceedingly chilly that it sometimes fell
in the form of hail. It was in this time of discomfort that Mick Otter
suggested the removal of headquarters to Racquet Pond. He said, very
truthfully, that the farther camp was warmer and drier than the lean-to
and that the farther line of traps had already beaten the Pappoose line
by three mink and a fox.</p>
<p>“Do pretty good with ten traps on Racquet,” he said.</p>
<p>“Take the traps, if you want to,” replied Tom, “but I stay right here
until something happens.”</p>
<p>So Mick moved alone, taking his blankets, the kettle and frying-pan,
some of the grub and two traps along with him. Bad as the weather was,
Tom immediately set out for the clearings, to borrow another pan and
another kettle. He spent a very pleasant evening with Catherine and her
grandfather.</p>
<p>Tom was to recall that happy and comfortable evening often before
spring. Catherine was as frankly friendly as ever—but the old man’s
attitude toward him was not quite as usual. It was as friendly as ever,
but different. Tom caught the old man gazing at him several times with
an expression of new interest, curiosity and wonder in his searching
eyes.</p>
<p>“You aren’t saying much to-night,” remarked Tom, after his host had sat
silent for nearly an hour and two games of chess had been played.</p>
<p>“An’ thinkin’ all the more, lad,” replied Gaspard, pleasantly.</p>
<p>“But what about, Grandad?” asked Catherine.</p>
<p>“One thing an’ another, one thing an’ another—but mostly about human
vanity an’ ignorance an’ the hand o’ Providence,” answered Gaspard.</p>
<p>The young people let it go at that. They smiled at each other across the
corner of the table and set up the chessmen again. The subjects of human
vanity and ignorance did not touch their imaginations, and they were
well content with the workings of the hand of Providence.</p>
<p>Tom left the house after breakfast, with a light pack on his shoulder.
His heart was light, too, though the sky was gray and a cold and gusty
wind blew smothers of icy rain across the clearings. Upon reaching camp
he immediately built up the fire, which lay full length across the front
of the lean-to, dried himself thoroughly and smoked a pipe. The heat and
cheery light beat into the shelter, thrown forward by mighty back-logs.
Hail-stones rattled in the trees, hopped on the frozen moss and hissed
in the hot caverns of the fire. A big, smoke-blue moose bird or “whiskey
jack” fluttered about the camp, harsh of voice, confiding, and possessed
of curiosity in that extreme degree that is said to have killed a cat.</p>
<p>Tom felt happy in the present moment and situation. He even felt that
his happiness might well be established here for a lifetime, if only the
great world, from which he had parted so violently and suddenly, would
continue to leave him in peace. He was glad that he had not followed
Mick Otter and the lure of peltries seven miles farther afield. He felt
that the distance of six miles was quite far enough for any sane person
to be separated from Gaspard Javet’s clearings.</p>
<p>He dined at mid-day on tea and bacon and Catherine’s bread and
Catherine’s home-made strawberry jam. He fed the attentive moose bird
with rinds of bacon and bits of bread soaked succulently in hot fat. The
rain and hail ceased early in the afternoon. He left the shelter and
worked his ax for an hour, felling and trimming selected trees for fuel.
The moose bird kept him company, flitting about him and attending upon
every stroke of the ax as if expecting it to produce bacon rinds,
instead of chips. Then he inspected the three traps that Mick had left
with him. They were empty—but their condition did not chill his sense of
contentment in the least.</p>
<p>Soon after supper he heaped the long fire high with green logs and
rolled himself in his blankets. The night was frosty, but the gusty wind
had gone down with the sun; and the fire-lit shelter seemed an
exceedingly comfortable and secure retreat to him. To fully appreciate
comfort, one must be within arm’s-length of discomfort or but recently
emerged from it. Thousands of persons in steam-heated places with
electric bells and janitors do not know what they are enjoying—or what
they are missing.</p>
<p>Tom was fully conscious of his comfort. He lay for some time with his
eyes half open, gazing up at the flicker of firelight on the poles and
tarpaulin overhead; thinking drowsily of Catherine MacKim, and of
Gaspard with his good heart and extraordinary beliefs; and of Mick
Otter. He liked Gaspard better than any other elderly person of his
acquaintance, despite the old woodman’s embarrassing ambition to deal
with the supposed devilish powers of the air with a rifle. And he liked
Mick Otter, too. In short, he liked every one he had met in Gaspard’s
clearings except Ned Tone. It was really wonderful how full his heart
was of affection and how entirely he seemed to have finished with
worldly ambition. He would make an early start on the morrow for Racquet
Pond, to see how that amusing old Indian was getting along; and he would
visit the clearings again on the day after that, for a game of chess. A
fine game, chess—an old and romantic game—an ancient pastime of kings
and queens. He fell asleep and dreamed of kings and queens in romantic
costumes playing chess with ivory pieces—and all the queens looked like
Catherine MacKim.</p>
<p>Tom was awakened by the clutch of a hand on his shoulder. He didn’t
believe it at first. He tried to sink back, to submerge again, to that
delicious depth of sleep from which the hand had partially raised him.
But the grip of fingers tightened on his shoulders and he became
conscious of an insistent voice in his ear. He opened his eyes and saw
dimly that some one crouched over him. There was no more than a ghost of
light to see by—a pale filter of faint starshine; and there was no glow
from the fire across the open front of the lean-to, for it had fallen to
a bank of ash-filmed embers against the charred back-log.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Mick?” he asked, sleepily.</p>
<p>The dim figure drew back and stood upright.</p>
<p>“It isn’t Mick,” said Catherine, in an excited and distressed whisper.
“Ned Tone and another man are at the house—a policeman of some sort—a
detective. They came this afternoon—looking for you, Tom. I got away as
soon as they were asleep, to warn you.”</p>
<p>Tom was sitting up before she got this far with her statement, you may
be sure. He threw aside his blankets, stepped out from the shelter of
the tarpaulin and kicked a little pile of dry spruce branches onto the
coals. Tongues of flame licked up through the brush, crackling sharply;
and in the flickering light he turned to the girl and took her mittened
hands in his bare hands.</p>
<p>“You came alone!” he exclaimed. “Six miles through these woods in the
dark, alone! Cathie, you’re a wonder.”</p>
<p>“That’s nothing,” she said. “I knew the way and I’m not afraid of the
dark. The thing was to get here quickly. You must pack up immediately
and move over to Racquet Pond; and Mick Otter will know where to go from
there. You are lucky to have Mick for a friend.”</p>
<p>“I am lucky in my friends, sure enough,” he replied.</p>
<p>He persuaded her to enter the shelter and rest. He placed more wood on
the fire.</p>
<p>“How did it happen?” he asked. “What did Tone and the other fellow say?
Have they the right dope?—or is Tone just trying to start something on
his own?”</p>
<p>“They know you are Major Akerley—at least, Ned Tone feels sure that you
are. He saw an old newspaper in Millbrow, with your story and photograph
in it—a copy of the same paper that Mick Otter saw, I suppose. Then he
got hold of this detective and brought him in. They reached the
clearings about supper-time. They haven’t told Grandad what they want
you for, so of course he thinks the stranger is a game warden from the
St. John River. Ned Tone showed me the paper and sneered about my new
friend who is wanted by the police—but I laughed at him. His idea is
that you came down somewhere in the woods and that I didn’t know who you
were until he told me—that you had lied to me and fooled me.”</p>
<p>Tom put on his boots and outer coat. He looked at his watch and saw that
it was one o’clock in the morning.</p>
<p>“We had better start,” he said. “You won’t get much sleep, as it is.”</p>
<p>“We?” she queried. “You have to pack and go to Racquet Pond and warn
Mick.”</p>
<p>“I’ll see you safely home first.”</p>
<p>“But there is no time for that, Tom! You are in danger. You must get
away with Mick Otter as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“I need ammunition for Mick’s rifle, and my leather coat. You must let
me go with you—or I’d worry all the time until I saw you again. We
really do need cartridges, Cathie—and I don’t think a couple of hours
will make any difference. They won’t make a bee-line for Pappoose Lake
in the morning.”</p>
<p>So he saw her home; and on the way they decided on the following plan of
campaign. Tom was to keep far away from Gaspard’s clearings, in such
hidden recesses of the wilderness as seemed best to Mick Otter, for six
full weeks. If he and Mick were still at liberty and unmolested at the
end of that time, Mick was to pay a cautious visit to the camp on
Racquet Pond. There he would find either a blank sheet of writing paper
or a sheet of paper marked with a black cross; and the blank paper would
mean that they might safely return to the clearings, to the best of
Catherine’s belief; and the black cross would mean that the danger was
still imminent. Should Mick find the cross, he and Tom would take to the
trackless wilds again without loss of time and refrain from visiting
Racquet Pond in search of further information until after the middle of
January.</p>

</div>
<p>The house in the clearing was dark and quiet as the grave when Catherine
and Tom reached it. Blackie did not bark at them, for he was with them,
shivering cheerfully at Tom’s heels from the combination of loyal
enthusiasm and chilliness. Catherine entered the house, as silent as a
shadow of the night. Tom went to one of the barns and unearthed his
wool-lined leather coat and with it on replaced the patched mackinaw of
Gaspard’s which he had been wearing. He returned to the house just as
Catherine reappeared with twenty-five of her grandfather’s cartridges,
half a dozen cakes of his tobacco and a small bag of flour.</p>
<p>Tom received these things from her hands with mumbled words of thanks.
He behaved so awkwardly that he dropped the tobacco and had to get down
on his hands and knees to recover it.</p>
<p>“Snowshoes and moccasins,” she whispered. “I almost forgot them; and I’m
sure it will snow before morning.”</p>
<p>Again she slipped into the sleeping house; and again she returned, this
time with a pair of cowhide moccasins, an assortment of woolen socks and
two pairs of snowshoes. They retired to a safe distance from the house
and there made everything into a pack of sorts. She helped him lift the
pack to his shoulders and adjust it.</p>
<p>“Now you must go, you must hurry,” she said.</p>
<p>He extended his mittened hands and rested them lightly on her shoulders.</p>
<p>“I’ll go—and I’ll hurry, of course,” he replied, in husky and hurried
tones. “But if it wasn’t for you I wouldn’t move an inch—I’d let them
catch me and court-martial me and break me. Hunted by those fellows! A
fugitive! But they’ll forget it some day—and that’s the day I am praying
for—the day when I can tell you what I think of you, Cathie MacKim!”</p>
<p>Next moment she was gone from beneath his extended hands—gone, and
vanished in the gloom toward the blacker gloom of the silent house.</p>
<p>He stood motionless for fully a minute, scarcely breathing, with his
hands still extended. Then his arms sank slowly to his sides and his
breath escaped in a gasping sigh of suggestive astonishment and even
greater emotion. He hitched his pack higher, turned abruptly and headed
northward through the cold and dark. But cold as it was and dark as it
was he felt as warm as toast and stepped out as assuredly as if the sun
were shining.</p>
<p>“By thunder, she kissed me!” he whispered. “Quick as winking—but that is
what it was! They can’t catch me now, the poor Rubes—not in fifty
years!”</p>
<p>He would probably have continued in this high strain for several minutes
had he not strode squarely into the raking barrier of a brush-fence.
After that, he walked with more circumspection; but in spite of a
scratched face and a barked skin he felt at the top of his form.</p>
<p>The snow which Catherine had predicted began to circle down just as Tom
reached his camp on Pappoose Lake. He placed his pack in the lean-to,
fed the fire, and then went out and brought in his three traps. One had
a mink. Returning to the camp he made all his possessions—including the
tarpaulin and the dead mink—into two formidable packs. He shouldered one
of these and started for Racquet Pond.</p>
<p>It was close upon seven o’clock in the morning, and snow was still
falling, when Tom reached the camp on Racquet Pond. He found Mick Otter
up and breakfasting by the light of the fire in the middle of his floor.
He explained the situation without loss of time, in the fewest possible
words.</p>
<p>“Got you,” said the old Maliseet, gulping the last of his mug of tea as
he rose to his feet. “I go. You eat breakfas’, then fetch in two trap by
brook, then pack. Git other five trap sometime maybe. Don’t matter now.”</p>
<p>Tom breakfasted and lit his pipe. He brought in the two nearest traps,
which were empty. The snow continued to circle down through the windless
air. The morning came on grayly, without a gleam of sunshine. He made
another pack of everything that he could find about the camp—pelts dried
and fresh, provisions and blankets and the two traps—and wondered what
was to be done with all this luggage.</p>
<p>It was ten o’clock when Mick Otter appeared, staggering. He dropped his
load, shook and beat the clinging snow from his head and shoulders and
sat down with a grunt in the doorway of the shack.</p>
<p>“You make darn bad pack,” he said.</p>
<p>He pulled the mitten from his right hand, produced a short clay pipe
from somewhere about his person and passed it over his shoulder, without
turning his head.</p>
<p>“You fill a pipe,” he said. “You got dry ’baccy, what?”</p>
<p>He was a generous man, but he always made a point of cadging tobacco.</p>
<p>Tom, who stood behind him, took the pipe, filled it and returned it,
then lit a splinter of wood at the fire and held the flame to the bowl.
Mick puffed strongly.</p>
<p>“That a’ right,” he said. “Chuck fire out now. Smoke smell long ways.”</p>
<p>Tom obeyed, tossing the fire out into the new snow brand by brand.</p>
<p>“Good,” said Mick. “This snow darn good too, you bet. Don’t let up
one-day, maybe. We make toboggan now an’ git out, what.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you say,” replied Tom. “You are in command, so long as we stay
on the ground. But what shall we make the toboggan of, and how long will
the job take us? We are supposed to be in a hurry, I believe.”</p>
<p>Mick got to his feet, ax in hand, and walked to a big spruce that
towered nearby, all of it but the brown base and lower branches lost to
view in the twirling white veils of snow. He hoisted himself to the
lowest branch and lopped it off. Thus he cut six tough, wide branches.
With these, and strips cut from a blanket, he quickly fashioned what he
was pleased to call a toboggan. Upon it he laid all the packs and
fastened them down with the tarpaulin. He rigged strong traces of
blanket to the forward end of the thing.</p>
<p>“Now we pull him,” he said. “Guess he slide pretty good; an’ the snow
fill up his track darn quick.”</p>
<p>They rounded the western end of the pond, dragging their possessions at
their heels. They headed north then, pulling like horses, each with a
rope of blanket over a shoulder and gripped in both hands. The toboggan,
so called, stuck frequently and had to be yanked this way and that and
lifted by the stern. It was hard work and slow progress—but they kept at
it without rest until three o’clock in the afternoon; and the snow
continued to fall thickly and windlessly all that time.</p>
<p>They pulled into a close thicket of young spruces, made a small fire and
boiled snow for tea. After eating a few slices of bread and drinking a
kettleful of tea, they lit their pipes and continued their journey. The
visionless day darkened to black night; and still they toiled forward.
The light, new snow took them to the knees. It was rough going all the
way, with never more than a few yards of level ground at a time—over
blow-downs and hidden hummocks of moss and hidden rocks, and through
tangles of every variety of underbrush. Mick Otter missed his footing
and fell twice and Tom did the same thing four times. Twice one of the
packs worked loose and fell off; and at last the sledge itself fell
apart from sheer wear and tear.</p>

  <img src='images/illus-f174.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
<p class='caption'>“IT WAS HARD WORK AND SLOW PROGRESS.”</p>
</div>
<p>“Guess we go far ’nough to-night,” said the old Maliseet.</p>
<p>They cleared themselves a space in the heart of a clump of cedars and
rigged the tarpaulin for a roof. As the snow was still falling thickly
they permitted themselves a good fire. They took to their blankets and
fell asleep before the bowls of their after-dinner pipes were cold.</p>
<p>When the fugitives awoke just before the first pale shimmer of dawn the
snow had ceased to fall—but it lay all around them almost hip-deep and
clung to the bowed tops and branches of the forest in great masses. They
fried bacon and boiled the kettle at a mere pinch of fire. They
constructed a new and stronger drag for their baggage, changed their
boots for moccasins, donned their snowshoes and pulled out. The east
showed silver, then red, then gold through the snow-burdened towers of
the forest. Presently the sun lifted above the world’s edge, and with it
arose a vigorous wind. Before that wind the light snow went up in
clouds, even in the sheltered woods; and it fell from the shaken trees
in showers and masses.</p>
<p>“Good,” said Mick Otter. “Snow hide our track yesterday, wind hide him
to-day.”</p>
<p>“We seem to be playing in luck,” replied Tom; and then, “Are you heading
for anywhere in particular?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Git to one dam good camp by sundown, maybe,” answered Mick. “Have
buckwheat flapjacks an’ molas’ for supper, maybe.”</p>
<p>“A camp!” exclaimed Tom. “Do you mean a lumber-camp? That would be a
crazy thing to do!”</p>
<p>“Nope, don’t mean lumber-camp. Camp I make long time back. Live in him
three-four week las’ winter.”</p>
<p>An hour later, while crossing a corner of open barren, they were almost
smothered by the drifting snow. And the cold was piercing. Also, the
lightness of the snow made the “going” exceedingly difficult—but this
condition improved as the wind drove it into white headlands and packed
it tight.</p>
<p>Before noon, the backs of Tom’s legs were attacked by snowshoer’s cramp.
It was exactly noon when he relinquished the painful struggle and sat
down with a yelp of pain. Mick Otter saw what the trouble was at a
glance. He made a fire and dragged Tom close to it. Then he produced a
pot of bear’s grease from the luggage, melted a quantity of it and
rubbed it vigorously into the cramped muscles of Tom’s legs. Tom held
his nose.</p>
<p>“If the detective gets a whiff of that he will track us around the
world,” he said, at the conclusion of the operation.</p>
<p>“We don’t go ’round the world, so that a’ right,” replied the Maliseet.</p>
<p>The bear’s grease proved to be as potent as it smelt; and by the time
dinner had been cooked and eaten, Tom’s muscles were free from pain and
comparatively limber. But it was not until a full hour after sunset that
Mick Otter halted and said they had arrived. He let fall his trace and
vanished in a wall of spruces. Tom backed up and reclined on the loaded
drag; and presently he saw the glow of firelight through the heavy
branches and crowded stems of the thicket.</p>
<p>“Come in,” called Mick. “Plenty time unload after supper.”</p>
<p>The camp was one to be proud of. It was at least thirty feet long. In
width it dwindled from about fifteen feet to as many inches, and its
height permitted Tom to stand upright. Its front wall was built of logs
and a part of the roof of poles and brush. The sides and the greater
part of the roof were of rock and earth. It pierced the rugged hill at a
gentle slant. It had been a brush-filled little gully backed by a little
cave inhabited by a large bear, when Mick Otter first found it, many
years ago.</p>
<p>When Tom scrambled through the small doorway, his snowshoes still on his
feet, he found the place full of smoke from the newly lighted fire. The
fire burned in a chimney of mud-plastered stones that went crookedly
upward against one rocky wall and vanished through the roof of poles.
Tom remarked on Mick’s evident appetite for smoke, remembering the camp
on Racquet Pond.</p>
<p>“A’ right pretty soon, you bet,” said Mick. “Coons make nest in the
chimley, maybe, or maybe snow stuff him up. One darn good chimley,
anyhow. He suck up smoke fine most times.”</p>
<p>Snow was the trouble; and at that moment a bushel of it slid down and
extinguished the fire, leaving the owner and his guest in absolute
darkness.</p>
<p>“That a’ right,” said Mick. “Now he suck up smoke fine.”</p>
<p>He quickly cleared the snow and wet faggots from the hearth and laid and
touched a match to dry bark and dry wood. He was right—the smoke went
straight up the chimney in the most knowing manner. He was pleased.</p>
<p>“You don’t find no better chimley nor him in Fredericton nor Noo York
nor Muntree-hall,” he said.</p>
<p>Then, working by the increasing illumination from the hearth, he raised
a square of poles from the floor—a thing that looked more like a
miniature raft than a door—and propped it across the low entrance of the
cave.</p>
<p>“He have two good hinges made of ol’ boot las’ winter, but some darn
b’ar come along an’ bust him in, I guess,” he explained.</p>
<p>“Don’t apologize,” said Tom, kicking off his snowshoes and throwing
aside his fur cap and leather coat. “If I had been the bear I would have
stayed right here till spring, once I had forced the door.”</p>
<p>He sat down on a heap of dry brush close to the fire. Mick went to the
far end of the cave, to investigate the condition of the stores which he
had left there the winter before.</p>
<p>“That b’ar stop plenty long enough!” he exclaimed. “He eat all the prune
an’ all the backum, darn his long snout!”</p>
<p>“Is that so!” cried Tom, now keenly interested. “And what about the
molasses?”</p>
<p>“He don’t git that molas’, no,” replied Mick. “He don’t have no
corkscrew ’long with him that trip, I guess.”</p>
<p>“And the buckwheat meal? How about that?”</p>
<p>“Buckwheat a’ right, too.”</p>
<p>“I’ll fetch the pan and the kettle and the baking powder.”</p>
<p>The supper was a success. The flapjacks, fried in a pan greased with a
rind of bacon and flooded with molasses at the very moment of
consumption, were delicious. Even the two that missed the pan in the act
of turning and flapped into the fire lost nothing in flavor.</p>
<p>After supper they brought in the outfit and spread their blankets to
warm. There was enough dry fuel inside to last for several days.
Outside, the wind continued to blow and the snow to drift before it.</p>
<p>In the morning they found the hingeless door banked high with snow; and
upon pushing their way out they found the trail of their approach
drifted full up to the edge of the dense wood which screened the front
of their retreat. A land of small, heavily wooded hills lay around them.
The sky was clear, a thin wind was still blowing and the air was
bitterly cold. They made their way over the roof of their dwelling and
up the rough slope behind, plunging and squirming through tangles of
brush and snow hip-deep; and, upon reaching the crown of the hill, Tom
climbed into the spire of a tall spruce. From that high perch he could
look abroad for miles in every direction. He looked back over the
country through which they had made the laborious journey, and saw
nothing but black forests and gray swamps; with here and there the pale
trunks of birch trees, and here and there a ridge of high gray maples
and beeches, and patches and strips of gleaming snow everywhere. Nothing
moved but the wind, and thin, sudden clouds of snow that puffed up and
ran and sank before it. No least haze of smoke, no sign of human
habitation or trafficking, tinged the clear air above the forests or
marred the white of the open spaces. He turned his head and searched the
bright horizon all around the world and every square yard of the
landscape within his range of vision. There was no smoke or ghost of
smoke anywhere, nor any break in the timber that looked as if it had
been cut by the hand of man, nor any sign of movement on the patches and
lanes of snow. He descended and reported to Mick Otter.</p>
<p>“That a’ right,” said Mick. “Guess we stop here an’ see what happen,
hey? Don’t make no tracks in front an’ lay low, what?”</p>
<p>“Sounds good to me—but what about our smoke?” asked Tom.</p>
<p>Mick pointed down the southern slope of the hill, where the underbrush
between the boles of the wide-limbed spruces and firs grew thick and
interlaced.</p>
<p>“Darn little smoke git through that,” he said. “Burn dry hard-wood all
day, anyhow—an’ mighty little of him.”</p>
<p>“It seems to me that we might stay here until Tone and the detective
chuck it. If we keep a sharp look-out they won’t catch us in daylight;
and they’ll never find that cave at night. It suits me. I don’t want to
go any farther away than I have to.”</p>
<p>“Maybe—but we stop here only two-three day, to rest up an’ look out. Go
north an’ west then, to place I know where we buy grub—an’ find little
camp of mine pretty near the hull way. Maybe they don’t know nothin’
’bout you over to Timbertown—so we trap an’ make some money, what?”</p>
<p>“Buy grub? We have enough to last us weeks—and I haven’t a dollar.”</p>
<p>The Maliseet smiled and tapped his chest with a mittened finger.</p>
<p>“Got plenty dollar an’ plenty fur, me, Mick Otter,” he said.</p>
<p>They worked all that day and the next at the construction of a real
toboggan, leaving their work only to eat, and to climb into the top of
their look-out tree once in every couple of hours of daylight. They
failed to discover any sign of pursuit.</p>
<p>This toboggan was made of thin strips of seasoned ash which Mick had
prepared for this very purpose two years ago. These were held in place,
edge to edge, by numerous cross-pieces of the same tough wood; and as
they lacked both nails and screws they had to tie the cross-pieces down
with thongs of leather. They were without a gimlet; they hadn’t even a
small bit of wire to heat and burn holes with; so the numerous holes
through which the thongs of leather were passed had to be bored and cut
with knives—Mick Otter’s sheath-knife and Tom’s pen-knife. The strips of
ash of which the floor of the toboggan was formed were an inch thick.
They bored and they gouged. They raised blisters in unexpected places on
their hard fingers. Tom broke the tips off both blades of his knife. But
they stuck to it and made a good job of it.</p>
<p>They buried half of their wheat flour and a little of their bacon in the
cave, along with the half-full jug of molasses and the tin can of
buckwheat meal, and banked the low door with logs and brush. Then they
dragged their new toboggan up and over the hill and down its northern
slope. The newly-risen sun showed a hazy face above the black hills, and
the light wind that fanned along out of the east had no slash or sting
in it.</p>
<p>“That snow work for us agin, maybe,” said Mick Otter.</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>Back in Gaspard’s clearings the days had not passed so pleasantly nor so
uneventfully. You may remember Catherine’s parting with Tom in the dark,
outside the big log house, and the effect of her parting action on Tom.
In that case I need only say that she had been almost as keenly and
deeply affected as Tom by her action. Her astonishment had been almost
as great as his—but not quite, of course. She had slipped into the house
again and safely up to her room without disturbing any one of the three
sleepers, and had lain wide awake for hours. At five o’clock she had
heard sounds in the house—the voices of Ned Tone and the detective, then
the voice of her grandfather; then the rattling and banging of the lids
and door of the stove. But she had continued to lie still, denying her
hospitable instincts. She had heard the front door open and shut half an
hour later; and then she had left her bed, gone to her open window and
thrust her hand out between the woolen curtains. She had smiled happily
at the touch of the big snow-flakes on her hand. Then she had dressed
and gone downstairs and found her grandfather seated alone at the
lamp-lit table, feeding scraps of scorched bacon to Blackie.</p>
<p>“I didn’t cook fer ’em nor eat with ’em,” he had said.</p>
<p>Gaspard had worked about the barns all that morning. Ned Tone and the
detective had returned to the house at noon. They had immediately asked
questions: Had the man who called himself Tom Anderson gone away alone?
Did he know these woods? When had they seen him last? Was he alone then?
Had he provisions and a rifle?</p>
<p>Catherine had smiled at these questions and Gaspard had scowled at them.
Neither had made the least pretence of answering them. Then Ned Tone had
blustered and spoken in a large, loose manner of the might of the law;
and old Gaspard Javet had confronted him with bristling eye-brows,
flashing eyes and quivering whiskers and threatened to throw him out of
the house. Then the stranger, the detective, had said, “Don’t lose your
temper and do anything rash, old man. I represent the Law here.”</p>
<p>“Prove it!” Gaspard had retorted.</p>
<p>The other had opened his inner coat and displayed a metal badge. Gaspard
had sneered at that, and had said, “I warn the two of ye right here an’
now to git out o’ my house an’ off my land. I reckon ye don’t know who I
am, stranger. If I fight my own battles agin the likes of Ned Tone an’
yerself, it ain’t because I hev to; an’ if I was to do a mite o’
shootin’ meself it wouldn’t be because I had to. This here Law ye talk
about wasn’t made jist so’s ignorant, no-count lumps like yerself an’
Ned Tone can clutter up an honest man’s kitchen. Clear out, or there’ll
be some shootin’ now—an’ maybe some law later.”</p>
<p>The man-hunters had gone reluctantly out into the storm and built
themselves a camp half a mile away. They had brought in with them
blankets, and enough provisions to last them ten days, from Boiling Pot.</p>
<p>“Do you think that was wise, Grandad?” Catherine had asked.</p>
<p>“It was right, anyhow,” the old woodsman had replied. “We ain’t hidin’
Tom. He went off with Mick Otter to trap fur, didn’t he; an’ if they
don’t know Mick’s along with him that’s thar own look-out. If any harm
ever comes to Tom, it won’t be my fault—nor yers either, I reckon.”</p>
<p>For two days after the expulsion of Ned Tone and the detective from the
kitchen, Catherine and Gaspard saw nothing of those unwelcome invaders;
and during that time the old man talked a great deal in a very truculent
manner of what he would do if they crossed his threshold again; and how
he would have handled Ned Tone in his prime; and what would happen to
them if they did catch Tom and Mick Otter; and what in thunder the world
was coming to, anyhow. It was loose and careless talk for so stiff and
elderly a person—but it warmed Catherine’s heart to hear.</p>
<p>On the third day Gaspard left the house immediately after breakfast,
rifle in hand as usual, and did not return until close upon one o’clock.
He stood the rifle in a corner and sat down to his dinner without a
word. He ate in silence, looking at the girl frequently with an
expression of accusing inquiry in his deep-set eyes.</p>
<p>“What is the matter?” she cried, at last. “Why do you look at me like
that, Grandad?”</p>
<p>The old man was evidently embarrassed by the questions. He pushed back
his chair from the table and hooked his pipe from his pocket before
attempting an answer; and even then his answer was a counter-question.</p>
<p>“I wanter know if ye figger as how I be crazy?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Crazy?” said the girl, in her turn embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Yes, crazy,” he replied. “Not ravin’, but queer.”</p>
<p>He tapped his forehead with a long finger, in an explanatory manner,
looking at her keenly but kindly.</p>
<p>“Queer about that thar devil,” he continued. “Kinder cracked about the
devil. That’s how ye figgered it out, I reckon.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Catherine. “You acted very queerly about that, Grandad,
raving around with your rifle.”</p>
<p>Gaspard nodded his head and sighed. Catherine left her seat and went
over and stood beside him, with a hand on his shoulder. She shook him
gently until he looked up at her.</p>
<p>“Do you remember that Tom once tried to tell you that man can fly, and
what you said and how you looked?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I remember,” he said. “I was queer.”</p>
<p>“It was Tom himself who flew down from the sky that night,” she said,
speaking quickly. “You would have shot him if you had found him before I
did. But as soon as he knew you, he wanted to tell you—but I wouldn’t
let him, I honestly thought you would kill him even then, Grandad.”</p>
<p>“Not after I knowed ’im, Cathie. I was queer—but knowin’ that lad, an’
workin’ longside ’im an’ talkin’ to ’im made me feel happier an’ put the
thoughts o’ that devil outer my head. An’ now the police are huntin’
that lad—not the game-wardens, but the police!”</p>
<p>“You knew, before I told you, Grandad. You found out about Tom to-day.
Where have you been?”</p>
<p>“I’ve bin studyin’ on it fer quite a spell now; an’ when I was forkin’
over some hay in the north barn this mornin’ I come on a queer
contraption that kinder put me wise. So I went over to Ned Tone’s camp;
an’ the both of ’em was still settin’ thar eatin’ breakfast. So I sez,
‘All ye lads ’ill ever catch in these woods is a cold’; an’ after a
little chat about the law I sez, ‘Ye seem almighty wrought up about a
salmon. That’ll be an all-fired costly fish by the time ye catch Tom
Anderson, I reckon.’ Then they up an’ told me how Tom’s name is Akerley
an’ how he’s wanted by the police an’ the military for worse things nor
spearin’ a salmon.”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you all about that, Grandad,” said the girl; and she told
him.</p>
<p>“And it was all my fault that he told you that story about losing his
canoe below Boiling Pot and about spearing salmon—because I told him
that you would shoot him for a devil if he didn’t make up a story—and so
you would have,” she concluded.</p>
<p>“Ye’re right,” said Gaspard, deeply moved. “I was ignorant—but I’ve
larned a lot since Tom come to these clearin’s. How was I to know that
men can fly in the air, like birds—onless Old Nick himself had his
finger in it? But it seems they can; an’ if Tom done it then I ain’t got
nothin’ to say agin it—but it do seem like temptin’ Providence. An’
soldierin’ in the air! That do seem to me a mite presumptuous—a flyin’
’round an’ fightin’ in the sky, like the angels o’ the Lord!”</p>
<p>Catherine went up to her room, and returned in a minute with Tom’s
service jacket. She explained the rank badges and the decoration and
medal ribbons to the old man. He recognized the red ribbon of the Legion
of Honor; and he had frequently heard from his son-in-law the story of
how Major MacKim had won that white and gold cross in the Crimea. Then
Catherine told him about the Military Cross, and what the war medals
signified—the ’14-15 Star, the General Service and the Victory.</p>
<p>“Tom fought on the ground before he fought in the air,” she said—“before
he knew how to fly, even. He was a lieutenant in a cavalry regiment that
went over without its horses with the First Canadian Division and fought
in the trenches as infantry—a regiment of Seely’s brigade. When our
cavalry was sent out of the line to get its horses—that was after Currie
had taken command of the division—Tom joined the Flying Corps, because
he thought that the mounted troops wouldn’t get much fighting. That was
in the winter of Nineteen-Fifteen; and since then he flew and fought all
the time, except when he was in hospital, until the end of the war.”</p>
<p>“An’ now this here detective, an’ this here bully from B’ilin’ Pot,
figger on catchin’ him an’ havin’ the law on him—fer hittin’ a fat
feller who named his dead friend, who died fightin’ in France, a
coward!” exclaimed Gaspard, in tones of rage and disgust. “Whar’s the
sense or the jedgment or the decency in that, I’d like to know? An’ him
still jumpy when he done it from flyin’ round an’ round ’way up in the
sky a-shootin’ at them Germans an’ them a-shootin’ at him! Law? Show me
law that ain’t got reason nor decency nor jedgment in it an’ I’m dead
agin it! What does Ned Tone know about shootin’?—’cept shootin’ off his
mouth an’ pluggin’ bullets into moose an’ sich that can’t shoot back? I
don’t know Seeley nor Currie, nor never heared of ’em before, but I know
that lad Tom; an’ ye kin tell me all ye want to about that war, Cathie.
I’d be glad to larn about it, for I reckon I be kinder ignorant an’
behind the times.”</p>
<p>Catherine told him what she knew of those momentous years and events,
which wasn’t very much. During the war she had seen an occasional
newspaper and magazine, and recently Tom had told her a good deal of
what he had seen. At the conclusion of the talk her grandfather was
deeply moved and torn with regret that he had not trimmed his whiskers
and shouldered his rifle and gone to war; and of two things he was
sure—that the Emperor of Germany had started a terrible thing in a
cowardly and dishonorable way and that Tom Akerley had jumped into it
and stopped it.</p>
<p>“An’ Ned Tone, the heaviest hitter on Injun River, reckoned as how he
could do what that thar Kaiser couldn’t!” he sneered.</p>
<p>When Gaspard went to the camping-place of Tone and the detective next
day, he found the shelter deserted and a trail heading toward Boiling
Pot. Two days later he found a new trail of snowshoes and a toboggan
running northward to the west of his clearings. He returned to the house
and informed Catherine of this: and together they followed it to
Pappoose Lake, where they found Ned Tone and the detective encamped,
with a tent and a fine supply of grub. They went back to the house
without having disclosed themselves to the sleuths. Gaspard set out
before sunrise the next day and found that the man-hunters had again
broken camp and moved on. He followed their tracks five or six miles
beyond the lake before turning back. He was late when he reached the
house, and his ancient muscles were very stiff and sore. But there was
great stuff in Gaspard Javet; so, after a day’s rest and a brief but
violent course of bear’s grease, Minard’s liniment and elbow grease, he
set out again on the trail of the trailers, this time carrying food and
blankets and an ax as well as his rifle. The snow was thoroughly
wind-packed by this time. None had fallen since that first heavy and
prolonged outpouring. He took a straight line to the point at which he
had turned back two days before; and from there he followed a difficult
trail. The erasing wind had been busy. There was no faintest sign of
that trail except where it pierced the heaviest growths of spruce and
fir; and even in such sheltered spots it was drifted to nothing but
occasional white dimples. He lost it entirely before sundown; but he
knew that it passed far beyond, and well to the westward of Racquet
Pond. He struck out for home next morning and accomplished the journey
without accident.</p>
<p>Two weeks passed without sight or sound of Ned Tone and the detective or
any news of the fugitives; and then one gray noon, when snow was
spilling down with blinding profusion, a knock sounded on Gaspard’s door
and Catherine opened to a fur-muffled and snow-draped Ned Tone.</p>
<p>“Stop whar ye be!” cried Gaspard from his seat at the dinner-table. “If
ye cross that threshold I’ll do fer ye. I run ye outer this house once,
an’ that was for keeps.”</p>
<p>Catherine stood aside, leaving the door open.</p>
<p>“Ye’re a hard old man,” said Tone, without moving. “What have I ever
done to ye that ye treat me like this—worse nor a dog? If it wasn’t that
we uster be friends, Gaspard Javet, I’d have the Law on ye for
interferin’ with the course o’ justice.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead,” replied the old man, drily. “It’ll make a grand story to
tell the magistrates down on the main river.”</p>
<p>Tone shuffled his feet uneasily.</p>
<p>“What I come here now for is to tell ye an’ Cathie as how I’ve quit
huntin’ that feller who was here,” he said. “I’ve told the police, that
detective ye seen with me, that I was mistook about that feller.”</p>
<p>“Ye must be reel popular with him,” remarked Gaspard.</p>
<p>“All I want is decent treatment from old friends,” continued the big
young woodsman. “That tramp’s nothin’ to me, whatever he done to git the
police after him—but he ain’t fit company for a girl like Cathie. I’ve
scart him away, an’ I’m ready an’ willin’ to let it rest at that.”</p>
<p>“Whar’s yer friend?” asked Gaspard.</p>
<p>“He’s went on out. I told him I’d made a mistake. He was sore at me, an’
I had to pay him for his time—but let bygones be bygones, sez I.”</p>
<p>“Ned Tone,” said the old man, slowly and clearly, “ye’re lyin’ quicker’n
a horse can trot right thar whar ye stand. I’d know it even if I didn’t
know yerself, fer it’s in yer eyes. Ye’re lookin’ fer money from the
Gover’ment, an ye’re lookin’ fer vengeance agin a young man whose got
more vartue in his little toe nor ye’ll ever have in yer hull carcass.
Ye fit him fair once, an’ he trimmed ye; then ye tried yer durndest to
send him astray in the woods, without a rifle an’ without grub; an’ then
ye fit him dirty an’ got trimmed agin; an’ now yer huntin’ him with the
help o’ the police. An’ ye know as how he be a better man nor yerself—a
man who sarved his country whilst ye hid under the bed; an ye know that
the thing he done that the law’s huntin’ him for, wouldn’t have been
nothin’ if it wasn’t that he’d sarved his country as a soldier an’ still
wore the uniform. An’ still yer so all-fired scart o’ Tom Akerley that
ye’d jump a foot into the air if ye knowed he was standin’ behind ye
this very minute.”</p>
<p>Ned Tone jumped and turned in a flash. But there was nothing behind him
except the twirling curtains of snow.</p>
<p>“Confound ye!” he cried.</p>
<p>“That’s all I got to say to ye, Ned Tone,” said Gaspard. “Shut the door,
Cathie.”</p>
<p>Cathie shut the door; and Ned Tone went slowly away and rejoined the
detective at the edge of the woods.</p>
<p>“I told them we was gettin’ out,” said Ned.</p>
<p>“Has Akerley been back?” asked the other.</p>
<p>“Guess not. They didn’t say.”</p>
<p>“Well, I got something better to do than spend the winter cruisin’ these
woods for a man you say is Major Akerley. A gent like that one would
head for a big town, as I’ve told you before. If you don’t show me him
or his machine inside the nex’ two weeks I’ll get out in earnest.”</p>
<p>“Keep yer shirt on! It was yer idee chasin’ him, wasn’t it? All we got
to do is hang ’round here, out o’ sight o’ the old man and the girl,
until he comes snoopin’ back.”</p>
<p>“Then he’d better come snoopin’ pretty darned quick or he won’t have the
honor of bein’ arrested by me.”</p>
<p>They moved to a secluded and sheltered spot five miles to the eastward
of the clearings and there went into camp. The snow filled in the tracks
of their snowshoes and toboggan.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mick Otter and Tom Akerley held on their way
undisturbed, traveling in fair weather and remaining in camp in foul.
Day after day they moved through a wilderness that showed neither smoke
nor track of human occupation, nor any sign of man’s use save occasional
primitive shelters, and small caches of provisions and mixed
possessions, for which Mick Otter was responsible. This was Mick’s own
stamping-ground, his country, the field of his more serious activities
and (apart from what food he ate at Gaspard’s place) the source of his
livelihood. Sometimes a whim drew him to the east or the west or the
south, but this was the area of wilderness that knew him every year and
had paid toll to him in good pelts for many years. He was familiar with
every rise and dip and pond and brook of it; and when on the move he
looked forward from each knoll and hill-top, as he gained it, with the
clear picture already in his mind’s eye of what he was about to see; as
a scholar foretastes familiar pleasures when turning the leaves of a
beloved book.</p>
<p>Of late years, however, Mick’s trapping operations in this wilderness
region of his own had been of a sketchy and indolent nature—had been
just sufficient, in fact, to let other Maliseet trappers know that he
was still in occupation.</p>
<p>He told this to Tom Akerley.</p>
<p>“But why?” asked Tom. “Aren’t furs worth more now then they ever were?”</p>
<p>“You bet,” replied Mick. “Worth four-six time more nor ever before. Sell
red fox two dollar long time ago—fifty year ago, maybe. But I got plenty
money now an’ plenty pelt too. You want some money, hey?”</p>
<p>“I’ll very likely want some, and want it badly, one of these days—if
those fellows don’t catch me,” replied Tom.</p>
<p>“Never catch you on this country long’s Mick Otter don’t die; an’ when
you want money, a’ right.”</p>
<p>“You are very good, Mick.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Good Injun, me.”</p>
<p>They were now far over the height-of-land; far out of the Indian River
country; far down a water-shed that supplied other and greater streams.
Even Mick’s trapping country was left far behind—but still he knew the
ground like a book.</p>
<p>One day, immediately after breakfast, Mick said, “Go down to Timbertown
to-day an’ buy some molas’ an’ pork an’ baccy. Come back to-morrow. You
stop here. Maybe they hear about you.”</p>
<p>“Will you trust me for the price of a razor?” asked Tom.</p>
<p>“Sure. But you don’t shave off them fine whisker till that policeman
quit huntin’ you. What else you want, hey?”</p>
<p>“What about a book for Cathie? But I don’t suppose they sell books in
Timbertown.”</p>
<p>“Good bookstore in that town, you bet. Buy plenty everything there. That
one darn good town. You smoke cigar, maybe.”</p>
<p>“Not a cigar, Mick—but I often wonder if cigarettes still taste as good
as they used to.”</p>
<p>“You like fat cigarette or little thin feller, hey? Doc Smith smoke the
fat feller an’ Doc Willard don’t smoke nothin’ but eat whole lot.”</p>
<p>“Books, cigarettes and two doctors!—it sounds like a city! But still I
haven’t any money.”</p>
<p>“That a’ right. You smoke him fat or thin, hey?”</p>
<p>“What about a little package of fat ones, Santa Claus? And I’ll write
down the name of a few books.”</p>
<p>Mick went away with his rifle on his shoulder and a few slices of bread
and cold pork in his pockets. He arrived home an hour before sundown of
the following day with a pack on his tough old back as big as the hump
on a camel.</p>
<p>“Buy all I kin tote,” he said, as Tom helped him ease the load to the
snow. “Take two-three a’mighty strong feller to tote what I got plenty
’nough money for to buy, you bet.”</p>
<p>They examined the pack after supper, by the light of candles which it
had contained. Here were cakes of tobacco, a small jug of molasses,
bacon, salt pork, a copy of Staunton’s “Chess,” a copy of Stevenson’s
“Black Arrow,” and a well-thumbed romance by Maurice Hewlett named
“Forest Lovers.” Also, here were cigarettes, a razor, a shaving-brush,
sticks and cakes of soap, rifle ammunition and a green and red necktie
of striking design.</p>
<p>“Give him Gaspar’ for Chrismus,” said Mick Otter, holding the tie aloft.
“He shine right through Gaspar’s whiskers, what?”</p>
<p>“You are right—but tell me about this book. Is there a second-hand
book-shop in Timbertown? I didn’t put it on the list, either—but it is a
good story. Where’d you get it?—this old copy of ‘Forest Lovers’?”</p>
<p>“That book? Doc Smith send him for you an’ Cathie.”</p>
<p>“What does he know about Cathie and me? Have you been talking all over
Timbertown about me?”</p>
<p>“Nope. Nobody there know you fly into the woods—but Doc Smith, he know
you fine—so I tell him.”</p>
<p>“He knows me! And you told him where I am hiding! Have you gone mad,
Mick? What’s your game?”</p>
<p>“Doc Smith one darn good feller. You trust him like yer own
trigger-finger, you bet. Good friend to me, Doc Smith—an’ good friend to
you, too. He know you at the war, doctor you one time, some place don’t
know his name, when you have one busted rib.”</p>
<p>“Smith? Not the M. O. with the red head; a jolly chap who sang ‘The
Fiddler’s Wedding’, who hung out just east of Mont St. Eloi in the
spring of ’Seventeen?”</p>
<p>“Sure. He say St. Eloi. He read all about you, but nobody ’round
Timbertown hear ’bout how you hide in these woods. He read how that
feller you hit go live on farm when all the soldier write to the paper
how he ain’t no good an’ you one a’mighty fine fighter; an’ Gover’ment
take your money outer bank an’ say how you still owe him seven thousand
dollar for flyin’ machine.”</p>
<p>“Is that so,” remarked Tom, reflectively. “Seven thousand—and took my
money?”</p>
<p>He lit a cigarette and smoked it slowly, in a silence so vibrant with
deep and keen thought that Mick Otter respected it.</p>
<p>“They’ve got my money,” he said, at last, “and they’ll have the old bus,
too, some day—but they’ll never catch me to hold a court on me. They’ll
never get my decorations!”</p>
<p>“What you mean, bus?” asked the Maliseet.</p>
<p>“The machine. The ’plane. Do you know where I can get oil and petrol?
Are there any gasoline engines in Timbertown?”</p>
<p>“Sure. Doc Smith got one, you bet, for to pump water. He got bath-tub,
too; an’ one little Ford what can jump fence like breachy steer.”</p>
<p>“Then he is the man I must see.”</p>
<p>Tom and Mick left the camp together next day, with an empty toboggan at
their heels. They timed their progress so as not to reach the town
before sunset. They went straight to Doctor Smith’s house and were
fortunate enough to find him at home and about to sit down to his
evening meal with Mrs. Smith, a lady of whose existence Mick Otter had
not informed Tom.</p>
<p>Smith recognized Tom instantly, in spite of the beard, and welcomed him
cordially.</p>
<p>“Dickon, this is Major Akerley, of whom I told you last night,” he said
to his wife; and at the look of consternation on Tom’s face he laughed
reassuringly.</p>
<p>“She is safe, major,” he continued. “She’d never peach on a good
soldier. I first met her under bomb-fire; and she wears the Royal Red
Cross when she’s dressed up.”</p>
<p>Tom talked freely during dinner; and after dinner he made known to the
Smiths his intention of assembling the aëroplane and returning it to the
Government in the spring. He said that he should require petrol and oil
and certain tools.</p>
<p>“Guess I can fit you out,” said the doctor; “but I advise you not to fly
up to the front door of Militia Headquarters and send your card in to
the Inspector General. Even those who don’t know why you hit Nasher
think that you did a good thing—but for all that, there’s the old mill
waiting to grind you. Keep away from it, major. Don’t force it to do its
duty.”</p>
<p>“You are right,” returned Tom. “If I can get the old bus patched up I’ll
fly her over here somewhere for you to discover and pass on. And I’ll
continue to lie low, officially lost—unless some fool starts another
war.”</p>
<p>“But do you mean to continue to hide in the woods until your case is
forgotten?” asked Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>“There are worse places than the woods,” replied Tom.</p>
<p>“So Mick Otter tells me,” remarked the doctor.</p>
<p>Tom and Mick did not go to bed that night; and long before sunrise they
pulled out of Timbertown with a small but hefty load on the toboggan.
They reached camp early in the afternoon; and before the next sunrise
they commenced their slow and cautious return to Mick’s
trapping-grounds. Again the wilderness was all around them, trackless
and smokeless save for the smoke and tracks of their own making. Days
passed without disclosing to them any sight or sign of Ned Tone and the
detective. One morning Mick killed a fat young buck deer. In time they
reached the cave, the snuggest and least conspicuous of Mick’s posts,
and found it undisturbed. Here they set out a short line of traps; and
then the Maliseet went on alone to Racquet Pond.</p>
<p>Mick found the little camp on Racquet Pond just as he had left it, save
for snow that had drifted in at the doorway and fallen in through the
square hole in the roof. If the pursuers had found it they had left no
sign behind them; but in a corner lay a square of white paper marked
with a black cross. Mick snorted at sight of the paper, then pocketed it
and laid in its place a red woolen tassel from the top of one of his
stockings.</p>
<div class='chapter'>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER X</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>MICK OTTER, MATCH-MAKER</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>Mick Otter scouted cautiously around Racquet Pond and took up the two
traps which had been left behind in the haste of the flight across the
height-of-land. One of them, set near an air-hole in a brook, had
evidently made a catch of a mink—but a fox, or a lynx, or perhaps
another mink, had visited the trap ahead of the trapper.</p>
<p>Mick returned to the cave and showed the marked paper to Tom; so the two
extended their line of traps and settled down to pass the time until the
middle of January as comfortably and profitably as possible. They kept
their eyes skinned, as the poet has it. Tom made a practice of climbing
the look-out tree four times a day when the weather was clear. They
refrained from firing the rifle; and they were careful to burn only the
driest and least smoky wood on their subterranean hearth, except at
night. Snow fell frequently and thickly. They were fortunate with their
traps, taking a number of red foxes and one patch, a few mink, an otter
and half a dozen lynx—all fine pelts; and with some very small traps
from one of Mick’s caches they even managed to catch a few ermine.</p>
<p>In the clearings, Catherine and Gaspard carried on and hoped for the
best. Catherine had made the trip to Racquet Pond with the warning to
the fugitives in a snow-storm, and so had left no tracks either going or
coming. Gaspard spied on the camp of the sleuths now and again; and,
finding it always in the same spot, he twigged their game. He wondered
how long their patience would last.</p>
<p>One morning the detective came knocking on the door of the big log
house. Catherine opened to him; and he entered weakly and sat down
heavily on the floor. One of his cheeks was discolored just below the
eye and his lower lip was swollen.</p>
<p>“A drink, please,” he said, in a voice of distress. “Anything—even cold
tea. I feel all tuckered out.”</p>
<p>The girl gave him a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>“Ye look kinder like ye’d caught up to Tom Anderson,” remarked Gaspard.
“An’ whar’s yer pardner?”</p>
<p>“Him!” exclaimed the detective, his voice shaken with anger. “That big
slob! He’s lit out for home—and beyond.”</p>
<p>“But he told us, weeks ago, that you had gone out to the
settlements—that both of you had given up looking for Tom Anderson,”
said the girl.</p>
<p>The detective swallowed the last drop of coffee, shook his mittens from
his hands, pulled off his fur cap and pressed his hands to his head.</p>
<p>“The liar!” he cried. “He’s a fool—and he’s made a fool of me, with his
story about that man Anderson bein’ an officer—the great Major Akerley.
I must hev been crazy to believe him for a minute. And now the big slob
has beat it for the settlements; and he’ll keep right on goin’, for the
Law’s after him now—or will be as soon’s I’m fit to travel agin.”</p>
<p>“Maybe yer lyin’, an’ again maybe yer tellin’ the truth,” said Gaspard.
“Howsumever, we’re listenin’.”</p>
<p>“I’m talkin’ Gospel,” replied the man on the floor. “Tone lit out last
night—but he beat me up before he left. He jumped onto me when I wasn’t
lookin’; and I guess he bust me a rib or two. I’m about all in, anyhow.”</p>
<p>So saying, he sagged back against the wall, toppled slowly sideways and
lost consciousness.</p>
<p>Gaspard Javet was greatly put out by this accident. He glared at the
unconscious man on the floor.</p>
<p>“If I was to lay him out in the snow till he come to, an’ then run him
off the place with the toe o’ my boot, it wouldn’t be more’n fair play,”
he muttered. “Tom would be in jail now if this sneak had had his way—an’
here he comes an’ lays down on my floor. I’m right glad Ned Tone smashed
’im; an’ I wish he’d smashed Ned Tone too.”</p>
<p>“We must do something for him,” said Catherine. “He may be seriously
hurt. The sooner we doctor him the sooner he’ll go away, Grandad.”</p>
<p>Gaspard snorted angrily and lifted the detective from the floor.</p>
<p>“I hope I’ll drop ’im an’ bust all the rest o’ his ribs,” he said; and
so he carried him carefully into his own room and put him down gently on
his own bed.</p>
<p>When the detective recovered consciousness he found himself very snugly
established between the sheets of Gaspard’s bed, and the old man
standing near with a steaming bowl in his hand. The bowl contained
beef-tea, and the detective drank it eagerly.</p>
<p>“Yer ribs ain’t bust, I reckon,” said Gaspard. “They ain’t stove clear
in, anyhow—but they do look kinder beat about,—an’ the color o’ yer eye.
What did Ned Tone hit ye with?”</p>
<p>“He knocked me down with his fist and then he whaled me with a stick of
firewood,” replied the other.</p>
<p>“I’m goin’ out to scout ’round a bit,” said Gaspard. “If ye git hungry
or thirsty while I’m gone give a holler an’ Cathie’ll hear ye. I put
arnica on yer ribs an’ tied ’em up with bandages.”</p>
<p>The old man went out and straight to the most recent camping place of
the sleuths. There he found the tent still standing, snugly banked with
snow: but Ned Tone was not there, nor were his snowshoes or rifle. The
provisions were scattered about, the tea-kettle lay upset in the ashes
of the fire, and an air of violence and haste possessed the entire camp.
A few bright spatters of blood marked the trampled snow; and Gaspard
correctly inferred that one of Ned Tone’s blows had landed on the
detective’s nose. Large, fresh, hasty snowshoe tracks led away from the
camp southward into the forest.</p>
<p>“He was sartinly humpin’ himself,” remarked the old man, setting his own
feet in the tracks. “I reckon he’s quit an’ lit out for home, like the
stranger said—but I’ll make sure.”</p>
<p>He followed the trail of Ned Tone steadily for more than an hour; and
every yard of it pointed straight for Boiling Pot.</p>
<p>Gaspard and Catherine nursed and fed the detective as well as if he had
been a beloved friend, and so had him up in a chair beside the stove in
two days; on his feet in three; and well able to undertake the journey
out to the settlements within the week. And he was as eager to go as
they were to have him gone—eager to go forth on the trail of Ned Tone
and to follow that trail until the treacherous, violent, cowardly
bushwhacker was brought to his knees before the might and majesty of the
Law. As for the case of Tom Anderson, he no longer felt the least
interest in it. It was his firm belief that even Tone had never really
suspected Anderson of being Major Akerley, but had invented the case
from motives of personal spite and greed. He did not find Ned Tone in
Boiling Pot, however; nor did he find him at Millbrow; nor yet in any
town on the big river. In short, he never caught up with the ex-heaviest
hitter on Injun River; and, for all I know, and for all the detective
knows, Ned Tone may still be on the run.</p>
<hr class='tbk' />
<p>Tom Akerley and Mick Otter returned to the clearings on the evening of
January the Seventeenth, in time for supper; and Catherine was ready for
them with roast chickens, mince pies and the best coffee they had tasted
since their departure from that wide and hospitable room. All four were
in high spirits—but it was Gaspard who made most noise in the expression
thereof. He told all that he knew of the adventures of Ned Tone and the
detective in the most amusing manner; and when he wasn’t talking he
chuckled.</p>
<p>“You feel darn good, what?” remarked Mick Otter, eyeing him keenly but
kindly. “Maybe you catch that devil an’ shoot him flyin’, hey?”</p>
<p>“Ye’re wrong thar,” replied Gaspard. “I found ’im, but he wasn’t flyin’.
Caught ’im on the ground—but I ain’t shot him yet. But I got his wings.”</p>
<p>Tom looked at Catherine and was relieved to see her smiling at her
grandfather.</p>
<p>“If you catch him on the groun’ why you don’t shoot him, hey?” asked
Mick. “You make a’mighty noise ’bout shootin’ him one time.”</p>
<p>“An’ Mick Otter laughin’ all the time at pore old Gaspard Javet for a
durn ignorant old fool. Well, I don’t blame ye, Mick, I’d hev laughed
meself to see me a-devil-huntin’ all the time, with my rifle handy an’
the devil mowin’ grass at my elbow or totin’ the old duck-gun ’round
helpin’ me to hunt himself.”</p>
<p>“So you know!” exclaimed Tom, getting quickly to his feet and staring
anxiously at the old man.</p>
<p>Gaspard made a long arm across the table.</p>
<p>“Lay it thar, lad,” he said, “Thank God I didn’t know when the
vainglorious madness was on me, when I was that et up with the pride o’
my wild youth an’ present piety that I reckoned on havin’ a reel devil
sent to me for to wrastle with—for I like ye, lad.”</p>
<p>“Me, too,” said Mick Otter. “You pretty big feller on these woods, Tom,
you bet. Gaspar’ like you too much for to shoot, an’ Mick Otter like
you; an’ maybe Cathie like you, too, one day, now Ned Tone go ’way with
policeman chasin’ him, what?”</p>
<p>Both old men gazed quizzically at the girl with their bright, kindly
eyes. She smiled a little, looked squarely at the swarthy round face of
the Maliseet, then at the bewhiskered visage of her grandfather, blushed
suddenly and deeply, and then said,</p>
<p>“I like him much more than either of you do—or both of you together; and
he knows it.”</p>
<p>Then Mick Otter actually chuckled; and as for Gaspard Javet, his
delighted laughter filled the room. And Catherine and Tom joined in the
old man’s mirth, but with an air of not quite seeing the joke. Gaspard
became silent at last and helped himself to a second piece of mince pie.</p>
<p>“She never told me before,” said Tom, very red in the face and short of
breath. “Not like that. And I—well, you know how it has been with me—and
still is, to a lesser degree. I had to keep how I felt under my hat—more
or less, I mean to say—as much as I could. She knew all the time, of
course. Didn’t you? How I felt, I mean—and that sort of thing. But as
things were with me—and still are, I suppose—well, I had to lie doggo.
What I mean is, I was a fugitive from justice. Only honorable thing to
do, you know. But now that you’ve seemed to notice it, and have
mentioned it, I feel myself at liberty to say that when I fell into this
clearing I fell for her, for you, I mean for Cathie. First time I saw
her, anyhow; and it has got worse—more so, I mean to say—ever since. But
I always wished that you knew the truth about me, Gaspard—for I didn’t
like pretending, and I wanted you to know that I was—that I wasn’t just
a breaker of game-laws—what I mean to say is, I wanted you to know that
I have fought bigger things than Ned Tone. I have been happier ever
since I landed to your light than ever before in my life, and—and now
that I know—well, I hope that I shall never again be chased out of these
clearings.”</p>
<p>The old men exchanged glances and approving nods; and Tom got hold of
Catherine’s hand under the edge of the table.</p>
<p>Life continued to go forward sanely and delightfully in the secluded
world of Gaspard Javet’s clearings. A spirit of cheer and security
possessed the big log house and the brown barns. Gaspard read his Bible
with more hopeful eyes than of old. He was in fine form and full of
brisk stories of his youth. He had learned to play chess—a game which,
until recently, he had eyed somewhat askance as an intricate and
laborious example of human vanity. Mick Otter spent much of his time in
the woods, but went no farther northward than to Racquet Pond nor
remained away from home for longer than four days at a time. He made one
trip south to Boiling Pot and found the villagers blissfully ignorant
and unsuspicious of the mysterious affair of Tom Anderson and Tom
Akerley, the flying major. His cautious inquiries proved them to be
equally ignorant of the whereabouts of Ned Tone. It was quite evident
that the heaviest hitter had kept his suspicions and the story of his
and the detective’s activities strictly under his hat.</p>
<p>Catherine and Tom were happy; but after that mutual declaration at
supper on the night of Tom’s return from the north, they both avoided
any further mention of the inspiration of their happiness. They knew
that their position was not yet secure from the menace of the outside
world. But they were not afraid, and they understood each other. Their
brains cautioned them to keep a sharp look-out beyond the southern edge
of the clearings and a firm grip on their dreams; and their hearts told
them that their future happiness was as secure as if no fat colonel had
ever been hit on the chin; and they heeded both their brains and their
hearts and sailed a delightful middle course.</p>
<p>Tom attended to a string of traps near Pappoose Lake, but seldom allowed
that business to keep him abroad all night. Also, he worked about the
barns with Gaspard and cut out firewood and rails. Catherine often
worked with him in the woods. The girl could swing an ax with the force
and precision of an expert chopper. She also helped with the threshing
of the oats and buckwheat, which was done at odd times; and in handling
a flail the extraordinary grace of her swing detracted nothing from the
force of her blow.</p>
<p>The necessity of making a journey to Boiling Pot, to obtain a supply of
wheat and buckwheat flour, made itself undeniably evident in the last
week of March. Mick Otter and Tom were both to go, for it was likely to
prove a formidable expedition owing to the fact that the long road
through the forests was entirely unbroken; but as Tom had done away with
his disguising beard, it was decided that he should not venture all the
way to the grist-mill in the village. Preparations were made during the
day before the start. A track was broken across the drifted clearing,
from the barn-yard to the mouth of the road. A few high drifts had to be
cut through with shovels. On the road, itself, the snow was not more
than knee-deep, for there had been a great deal of melting weather of
late. But there was a stiff crust which would have to be broken for the
safety of the horses’ legs. A light set of bob-sleds were fitted with a
light body and loaded with ten two-bushel bags of buckwheat and rations
of hay and oats.</p>
<p>Tom was up at four o’clock next morning, to water and feed the horses.
Breakfast was eaten half an hour later, by lamplight; and the horses
were hitched to the sled and a start made well before six. The air was
still and cold and the horses lively. For a few miles Tom led the way,
breaking the cutting crust ahead of the eager horses, and Mick held the
reins. Then, for a few miles, Mick broke the crust and Tom teamed. So
they toiled forward until noon; and as Tom was heavier and longer in the
leg and stronger than the old Maliseet, he did more breaking than
teaming. After a rest of two hours the journey was continued; and before
dusk they struck a well-broken road and the impatient horses went
forward at a trot. Tom dropped off a mile this side of the settlement,
with blankets and provisions, and made camp about fifty yards in from
the road.</p>
<p>Mick Otter did not reappear until noon. The return journey proved to be
an easy and speedy affair compared to the outward trip, in spite of the
heavier load. There was no crust to break, and Tom walked only
occasionally, for the exercise. It was not quite seven o’clock when they
issued from the forest into the clearing and saw the yellow lights of
the big log house gleaming on the snow. Tom was holding the lines at the
time and Mick was sitting hunched up beside him; and as the horses swung
to the left and pulled for the barns with a sudden burst of enthusiasm,
Mick slipped a small package into the pocket of Tom’s leather coat that
was nearest to him.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, in the kitchen, when Tom was stuffing his mittens
into his pockets, he felt the small package and produced it. He stepped
toward the lamp on the table, holding the package extended on the palm
of his hand.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” he said. “Where’d it come from?”</p>
<p>“Ye’d best open it an’ look, if ye don’t know,” suggested Gaspard,
crowding against his left elbow.</p>
<p>And so, with Gaspard on one side of him and Catherine and Mick Otter on
the other, Tom unwrapped the little package. Within the wrapper he found
a cardboard box, and within that a smaller box of a different shape and
material. This inner box had a hinged top that was fastened down with a
catch; and when Tom undid the catch and turned back the top he gasped
with astonishment at the thing he saw. Old Gaspard’s white whiskers
shook with excitement and Cathie’s cheeks and eyes brightened like roses
and stars. Mick Otter alone showed no sign of emotion.</p>
<p>“I didn’t buy this,” said Tom to the girl. “I haven’t any money, as you
know, and still owe the Government some thousands on account of a stolen
aëroplane. If this were mine, and all danger of my being cashiered were
past—”</p>
<p>“It was in your pocket,” said the girl.</p>
<p>“True; and I’ll pay for it when my skins are sold. Show me a finger,
please.”</p>
<p>She raised her left hand and extended to him a finger of peculiar
significance.</p>
<p>“On the understanding that you will transfer it to another finger if I
am caught and broken,” he said; and then he slid the ring into place.</p>
<p>“Never,” she whispered, closing her hand tight; and the little diamond
flashed defiant fire from her small brown fist.</p>
<p>“Mick Otter have to larn ’em how to get engage’,” said the old Maliseet,
in a voice of pity and mild scorn.</p>
<p>“Vanity! Vanity!” exclaimed old Gaspard, shaking his head slowly. “But I
reckon I never see a purtier little ring,” he added.</p>
<p>“What’s for supper?” asked Mick Otter, in sentiment-chilling tones.
“Hungry man can’t eat rings, nor vanity neither.”</p>
<p>They were seated at supper, and Gaspard was in the middle of a story of
his vainglorious past to which only Mick Otter was paying any attention,
when the latch of the front door lifted, the door opened slowly and a
figure muffled in blankets stepped noiselessly into the room. Gaspard,
who sat facing the door, ceased articulating suddenly and stared with
open mouth. Catherine and Tom glanced over their shoulders and Mick
Otter got to his feet and hurried to the visitor.</p>
<p>“Got sick pappoose here,” said the muffled figure, closing the door with
a heel and leaning weakly against it; and before Mick could get a grip
on it, it sagged slowly to the floor.</p>
<p>In his attempt at succor, Mick pulled a fold of the blanket aside, thus
disclosing the haggard face of a young squaw. The blanket fell lower and
a ragged bundle clutched tight in thin arms came to view; and at that
moment a faint, shrill wail of complaint arose from the bundle. This
brought Catherine flying and lifted Gaspard and Tom out of their chairs
and stunned Mick Otter to immobility. The girl took the bundle swiftly
but tenderly from the relaxing arms even as the squaw closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later both the mother and pappoose were in Gaspard’s
wide and comfortable bed, more or less undressed. A nip of strong
coffee, then a nip of brandy, had been successfully administered to the
squaw and a little warm milk had been spoon-fed to the baby; and all
this, except the carrying, had been accomplished by Catherine. Gaspard
and Mick Otter were of no use at all, though Mick was eager to get busy
asking questions. Tom warmed milk very well and filled two bottles with
hot water which were placed at the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>The pappoose wailed with a thin and plaintive voice for an hour, then
took a little more nourishment and fell asleep. The mother drank a bowl
of warm milk and slept like a log. It was close upon midnight when
Gaspard’s fur robes and blankets were laid on the floor of the big room,
between the robes and blankets of Mick’s and Tom’s humble and mobile
pallets.</p>
<p>Mick Otter questioned the young squaw industriously next day, but
acquired very little information. Her answers were suspiciously vague.
She did not seem to know how far she had come, or where from, or why.
She said again and again, in answer to every question, that the baby was
sick and needed a doctor; but the baby, full-fed now, seemed to be in
the pink of condition. Hunger and fatigue seemed to be the only thing
the matter with either of them. In three days they were both as right as
rain, beyond a doubt; and still the young woman would not say where she
had come from or why she had left home and seemed to entertain no idea
whatever of where she was bound for.</p>
<p>Mick Otter, anxious and thoroughly exasperated, took the case firmly in
his own hands at the end of a week. He made a snug apartment in one of
the barns, established a rusty old stove in it and, deaf to Cathie’s
protests, moved the visitors out of Gaspard’s room. The weather was mild
by this time. The barn-chamber was very comfortable. Mick made a fire in
the stove every morning and saw that every spark was dead before
bed-time. He carried all the squaw’s food and the baby’s milk to the
barn, forbade the others visiting the strangers and refused the
mysterious squaw admittance to the house. He was hard as flint in the
matter. One day he lost his temper with Catherine, who threatened to
have the mother and baby back in the house in spite of his cruel whims.</p>
<p>“You know her, an’ why she come here?” he cried. “Nope, you don’t know.
You know why she run away?—what she run away from? Nope nor me neither.
When we know, then you call Mick Otter one darn fool all you want
to,—maybe. What Mick Otter think,—what he see before two-three time—that
squaw run away from big sickness maybe with her pappoose. So you keep
’way—an’ shut up!”</p>
<p>Tom and Gaspard were far too busy to worry much about Mick Otter’s
peculiar treatment of the strangers. They had cleared the
threshing-floor of the largest barn and turned it into a work-shop; and
there, in a week, they had straightened and mended the buckled plane of
Tom’s old bus.</p>

</div>
<p>The machine was brought together bit by bit, from this hiding-place and
that. The little engines were assembled and tested. The car was put
together and the engines were fastened in place. Gaspard and Mick, and
even Catherine, could scarcely believe their dizzied eyes when the
little engines first turned the thin blades of the propeller over, and
then over and over until nothing was to be seen of those blades but a
gray vortex into which they had dissolved and out of which roared a wind
that threatened to blow the barn inside-out. The noise of that wind
frightened fur folk great and small miles away and sent crows cawing and
flapping out of distant tree-tops. It almost stunned the secretive squaw
with terror—for I think her conscience was not quite at ease; and it
even distressed Catherine. But Catherine was not feeling up to the mark
at this time. She had caught a slight cold, she thought; so she drank a
little ginger-tea and said nothing about it.</p>
<p>One evening in the first week in May an Indian came to the house and
asked if his squaw and pappoose were here and, if so, how they were
getting along. He looked an honest and somewhat dull young man and
complacent beyond words.</p>
<p>“You Gabe Peters from Tinder Brook,” said Mick Otter.</p>
<p>The visitor nodded. Then Mick took him by an elbow, backed him to the
threshold of the open door and talked to him swiftly in the Maliseet
tongue. The other replied briefly now and then. Mick became excited. His
excitement grew by leaps and bounds; and at last he turned Gabe Peters
of Tinder Brook completely around, kicked him from the threshold into
the outer dusk and shut the door with a bang.</p>
<p>Gaspard and Tom were stricken voiceless with amazement by Mick Otter’s
treatment of the visitor. Catherine seemed scarcely to notice it,
however. Mick turned from the door and went straight to the girl, where
she sat close to the stove.</p>
<p>“You go to bed,” he said. “Take plenty medicine an’ go to bed darn
quick.”</p>
<p>She protested, but without much spirit.</p>
<p>“Go to bed!” cried the old Maliseet, violently.</p>
<p>The girl stood up and moved toward the steep stairs. Tom hastened to
her, took her hands and looked at her closely.</p>
<p>“What is it, Cathie?” he asked. “Your hands are hot, dear.”</p>
<p>“I have a cold, I suppose,” she replied. “My head aches—and I think Mick
is crazy. But I’ll go to bed,—just to keep him quiet. Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>She went up to her room. Mick got Tom and Gaspard each by an elbow.</p>
<p>“Diptherie at Tinder Brook,” he whispered harshly. “That why Gabe
Peters’ squaw run ’way with pappoose. He don’t have it but he bring it
here, I guess. Cathie gettin’ sick, anyhow. Guess she need doctor pretty
darn quick.”</p>
<p>Gaspard Javet groaned. He had been so happy of late—or had his happiness
been only a dream? He sat down heavily in the nearest chair. Tom Akerley
paled but did not flinch. He looked steadily at the old Maliseet and in
a steady voice said,</p>
<p>“It may not be anything more than a cold, Mick. I’ll get a doctor
immediately—but you don’t think she is seriously ill, now, do you?”</p>
<p>“Dunno. Take too darn much chance a’ready, anyhow. Where you get a
doctor quick, hey? No doctor at B’ilin’ Pot. Go way out to Millbrow an’
find one darn poor doctor maybe. Take a’mighty long time anyhow—an’
maybe we don’t find him.”</p>
<p>Tom opened the door and looked up at the sky. It was a fine night. He
aroused Gaspard and sent him up to Catherine to consult her in the
matter of treatment for her own cold. Then, with two lanterns, he and
Mick Otter went out to the big barn. Tom set to work immediately. Mick
visited the mother and baby. He found Gabe Peters there and devoted a
few minutes to telling all three what he thought of them. He was
particularly severe with the squaw, because of her secretive behavior.
Then he returned to the work-shop and assisted Tom for three hours.</p>
<p>Tom was the first of the household to wake next morning. The first thing
he did was to go out and look at the weather. There was not a breath of
wind. The dawn of a fine spring day was breaking in silver and gold
along the wooded east. He woke Gaspard then, lit the fire and dressed.
Gaspard went up to Catherine’s room and found her sleeping—but she
tossed and moaned in her sleep. Her face was flushed.</p>
<p>Tom opened the doors of his work-shop wide and fell to work by the level
morning light. Mick Otter cooked the breakfast. Gaspard looked after
Catherine, who drank a little weak tea and complained of a sore throat.</p>
<p>Breakfast was eaten in ten minutes. Mick fed the three unwelcome guests
and locked them in their quarters. Then Tom, Mick and Gaspard worked
like beavers for two hours; and by the end of that time the ’plane
squatted wide-winged before the barn, like a wounded goose of gigantic
proportions. The three wheeled it to the top of the oldest and levelest
meadow.</p>
<p>Tom donned his leather coat and went to the house. He entered and called
up the stairs to Catherine. She answered him and he went up. He found
her lying bright-eyed and flushed of face, staring eagerly at the door.</p>
<p>“Oh, I am glad you are real!” she cried. “I was queer last night—and I
thought you weren’t real.”</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>“I am one of the realest things you ever saw, of my own kind,” he said.
“I’m no dream, Cathie. And now I’m going to make a little journey, to
fetch you a doctor—so when you hear my engines wish me luck, girl—put up
a little prayer for me.”</p>
<p>He stooped, touched his lips lightly and quickly to her hot forehead,
and left her. He ran to his machine and started the engines. He put on
his cap and goggles. He twirled the propeller; and suddenly it hummed.</p>
<p>“Stand clear!” and he scrambled to his seat.</p>
<p>The old bus thrilled, lurched, then moved forward down the field, slowly
for a few yards, then less slowly, then fast. Gaspard and Mick stared
after it, frozen with awe; and when they suddenly realized that the
little wheels were no longer on the mossy sod they felt as if their
hearts were stuck in their windpipes. Yes, the little wheels were off
the ground! And the wide wings were climbing against the green wall of
the forest; now they were swooping around; and now they were against the
morning blue; and still the great bird circled as it rose. Now it was
high over the house, high above the blue smoke from the chimney. Now it
was over the barns, and over the woods beyond, still circling and
rising. Four times it circled the clearings, flying wider and higher
each time; and then it headed north and flew straight away into the
blue.</p>
<p>Then those two aged woodsmen suddenly recovered the use of their lungs
and limbs. They shouted triumphantly and waved their arms in the air.
They leaped together and embraced.</p>
<p>The frail thing that flew northward with so much of their pride and love
dwindled and dwindled and at last vanished from their sight.</p>
<p>“An’ that’s the man Ned Tone fit with,” said Gaspard, in a voice
thrilled with pride and shaken with awe.</p>
<p>“An’ you an’ me help him fasten it together,” said Mick Otter, in tones
of reverence and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Gaspard returned to the house, and Mick went to the barn in which he had
shut the people from Tinder Brook and unlocked the door. The man and the
woman were in a tremor of fear. The fierce song of the birdman’s flight,
striking down at them through the roof, had chilled them with a nameless
dread. Mick gave them provisions, blankets, a kettle and frying-pan, and
told them to get out and travel quick. They obeyed with alacrity. He
told them that if they ever mentioned the great sound they had heard
that morning a terrible fate would overtake them swiftly, no matter how
far they traveled or where they hid; and they believed him, for truth
gleamed in his eyes.</p>
<p>Gaspard found Catherine sitting straight up in a tumbled bed, staring at
the window.</p>
<p>“Has he gone?” she cried. “Was it Tom? Has he flown away?”</p>
<p>“Now don’t ye worry, Cathie,” returned the old man, with an unsuccessful
attempt to speak calmly. “Yes, it was Tom. An’ he flew—ay, he surely
flew. He’ll fetch in a doctor for ye, girl, if thar be a doctor in the
world to fetch. I’ve saw eagles an’ hawks fly in my day, an’ wild geese
an’ ducks an’ crows, but nary a bird o’ the lot could fly like Tom. The
sight of it shook me to the vitals. If I was a young man only a few
years younger, nor what I be, I’d sure git him to larn me how to do it.
It was the shiverin’est sight I ever see—shiverin’er nor the swash an’
wollop an’ windy roar o’ fifty gray geese gittin’ up all of a suddent
out o’ the mist at yer very feet; an’ ye mind how that sets yer heart a
gulpin’, girl.”</p>
<p>Catherine lay back heavily on her pillow.</p>
<p>“Yes, I mind,” she said. “All the great wings beating the air. I wish I
had seen Tom fly. Now that my head feels so queer it all seems like a
dream to me—all about Tom—how he flew down to us that night, to the
light of our open door—and how brave and strong he is. I wonder if it is
true.... I wish I had a drink, Grandad. My throat is burning—and it
aches.”</p>
<p>Gaspard hastened away, pottered about the stove and the dairy, and soon
returned with milk hot and cold, cold spring water and hot tea. She
drank thirstily of the cold milk and water, talked for a few minutes in
a vague and flighty vein that terrified the old man, and then drifted
off into a restless doze.</p>
<hr class='tbk' />
<p>Tom Akerley flew straight and swift, high up in the spring sunshine,
into the clean bright blue of the northern sky. He held his course by
compass and sun, and read his progress on the ever unrolling expanse of
hill and vale and timbered level beneath him—so far below him that the
mightiest pines looked smaller than shrubs in a window-box and forests
through which he and Mick Otter had toiled for weary hours were scanned
from edge to edge at a glance. He saw the silver shine of lakes and
ponds like scattered coins and bits of broken glass; black and purple
vasts of pine and spruce and fir; gray dead-lands and brown barrens; and
here and there his exploring eyes caught a flush of red-budded maples, a
pale green wave of poplars in new leaf, and a smudge of yellow where
crowded willows hung out their powdery blooms. A flock of geese flying
northward with him at the same altitude, swerved from their course by a
few points as they came abreast of him and drew slowly ahead and away.
His machine was not the swiftest in the world, by any means, but it slid
along those free tracks of air at an unvarying rate of sixty miles an
hour; its taut sinews humming against the wind of its flight and its
trusty engines singing full and strong and smooth with a voice of
loyalty and power.</p>
<p>Doctor Smith and Mrs. Smith, of Timbertown, lunched that day with one of
the windows of the dining-room wide open, so bland and bright was the
air. They had trout from the mill-pond—the first of the season—and
steamed apple-pudding. Their trusty cook, who also waited on table, had
the platter of trout bones in one hand and the pudding in the other, and
was on the point of removing the first from before the doctor and
replacing it with the second, when a shadow fell across a corner of the
table. All three looked up and beheld a bare-headed young man in a
leather coat at the window.</p>
<p>The cook set the pudding down with a thump that split it from top to
bottom; but as the doctor and his wife jumped to their feet without so
much as a glance at the wrecked pastry, the cook also ignored it and
retired hastily with the platter of bones.</p>
<p>“Hello!” exclaimed the doctor. “Speak of the—we were just talking about
you, major. Come in. Glad to see you.”</p>
<p>“I’d better not,” replied Tom. “I’ve come to take you to Gaspard Javet’s
clearings. His grand-daughter is ill, and Mick Otter thinks it is
diphtheria,—thinks it came with some Indians from Tinder Brook. The bus
is about two miles away,—so if you’ll give me a tin of gas and come
along, I’ll be greatly obliged.”</p>
<p>The Smiths looked greatly concerned.</p>
<p>“I’m with you,” said the doctor. “A tin of gas? Right-o. Better put on
furs, hadn’t I? Eat something while I hustle. Feed the major, Dickon.”</p>
<p>As Tom persisted in his refusal to enter, from fear that he might have
the germs of diphtheria on his person, Mrs. Smith fed him on the
window-sill with cold ham and pudding and coffee.</p>
<p>“We were speaking of you just a little while before you appeared,” she
said. “Last week’s Herald arrived this morning, with good news; and we
were just wondering how we could get word to you; and here you are—with
bad news. But you mustn’t worry, major. Jim is a great doctor.”</p>
<p>“I know he is,” replied Tom. “I’ve seen him at work. He is a two-handed
man. And I haven’t wasted any time. Mick Otter threw the scare into me
last night and I nailed the old bus together and started this morning.”</p>
<p>“I am glad you hurried—but you’ll be careful, won’t you? Try not to
crash with Jim, please.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do the very best I know how, you may be sure. I promise you that
I’ll bring him back just as carefully as I take him away. I can’t say
more than that.”</p>
<p>“No, indeed. Now where is that Herald? Here is it.”</p>
<p>The lady picked up a newspaper from the floor and began to search its
columns for a particular item; but before she had found what she wanted
the doctor entered the room. He wore a fur cap and carried a fur coat on
his arm; in one hand was a professional bag and in the other a can of
gasoline. The lady folded the paper small and stuffed it into one of his
pockets.</p>
<p>“Take it with you,” she said. “It should bring you luck on the journey.”</p>
<p>He set his burdens on the floor and embraced her.</p>
<p>“Don’t expect me back till you hear us coming,” he said. “And don’t
worry, Dickon. If I had the pick of the whole Air Force for this trip
I’d pick the major.”</p>
<p>He took up his burdens and left the room, joining Tom in front of the
house. Tom led the way at a sharp pace to where the aëroplane lay in a
secluded clearing about two miles from the outskirts of the town. The
doctor had picked up a slight knowledge of air-craft during his service
in the army, so together they filled the petrol-tank and went thoroughly
over the machine. The result of the inspection was satisfactory. Then
Tom stowed the doctor and his bag aboard and donned his cap and goggles.</p>
<p>It was exactly three o’clock when the old bus took wing and flew
straight away into the south.</p>
<p>Mick Otter was the first of the family to catch the song of the homeward
flight. He was out in the wood-yard at the time, splitting up an old
cedar rail for kindlings. He dropped his ax and cocked his head. He
scanned the clear horizon and the blue vault above it, blinking his eyes
when he faced the west. At last he spotted it, and it looked no bigger
than a mosquito. It grew steadily in his vision and yet did not seem to
move; grew to the size of a snipe—continued to grow, hanging there
against the sky, until it looked like a lonely duck homing to its
feeding-grounds. And the sound of its flight grew too, droning in from
all round the horizon. Little Blackie heard it then and crawled
apologetically under the back porch.</p>
<div id='i271' style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-left:10.0%; width:80%;'>
  <img src='images/illus-f271.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
<p class='caption'>“HE ... THRUST HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS OUT OF THE WINDOW.”</p>
</div>
<p>Gaspard Javet heard it. He left his chair beside Catherine’s bed,
crossed the floor on tip-toe and thrust his head and shoulders out of
the window. He saw it, rubbed his eyes and looked again to make sure,
then withdrew from the window and turned to the girl in the bed.</p>
<p>“Here he comes,” he said.</p>
<p>Catherine moved her head restlessly on the pillow. Her eyes were wide
open, but she paid no attention to her grandfather’s remark. Instead,
she put out a hand gropingly toward a mug of water which stood on a
chair beside the bed. Gaspard went to her in one stride, raised her head
on his arm and gave her a drink. She swallowed a sip or two with
difficulty.</p>
<p>“Hark, Cathie girl,” he whispered. “Don’t ye hear it now? the hum o’
Tom’s flyin’-machine?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard it for hours,” she answered faintly. “It isn’t true. It is
in my poor head.”</p>
<p>“But I see it this very minute dear, when I looked out the winder. Thar
it was, plain as a pancake, a-hummin’ home like a big June-bug. It’s
Tom, I tell ye, and if he ain’t got a doctor with him then all the
doctors has died! Don’t ye hear it gittin’ louder an’ louder?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is growing louder,” she said, slowly, “louder than the noise in
my head has ever been—as loud as when Tom flew down out of the dark that
night and frightened you into the woods.”</p>
<p>Gaspard lowered her head to the pillow and hastened from the room in his
socks. He was in such a hurry that he left the door open behind him and
took the short, steep stairs at a slide. He got outside in time to see
the ’plane sink below the top of the dark wall of forest, flatten out
and run on the sod. He raced Mick Otter to it, shouting as he ran.</p>
<p>The doctor went up alone to see Catherine; while Tom, Mick and Gaspard
sat on the back porch and stared at the resting ’plane without a word.
Tom still had his great gloves on his hands, his goggles on his eyes and
his fur-lined cap on his head.</p>
<p>The doctor returned to them in fifteen minutes; at sight of the
expression on his face they all sighed with relief, and Tom pulled off
his gloves and head-dress.</p>
<p>“Mick, you were right,” said the doctor. “That’s what is the matter with
her, but it hasn’t got much of a hold. And she is strong and I’m here in
plenty of time.”</p>
<p>Mick Otter nodded his head just as if this good news was no news to him.
Gaspard leaned heavily on Tom’s shoulder. Tom took off his goggles and
fell to polishing them diligently with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>“Bless that old bus,” he said, making a swift and furtive pass with the
handkerchief across his eyes.</p>
<p>Doctor Smith pulled a cigarette-case and a folded newspaper from a
side-pocket of his coat. He lit a cigarette and then unfolded the paper.</p>
<p>“Ah! here it is,” he said. “Dickon and I were wondering how we could get
word to you about it, Tom. Here you are.”</p>
<p>He handed the big sheet to Tom, indicating this official advertisement
with a finger.</p>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>
<p>“Major Thomas Villers Akerley, M. C. This officer is hereby instructed
to apply at his early convenience for transfer to the Reserve of
Officers, with his present rank and seniority, and to return to any
Officer of the Permanent or Active Militia, with a complete statement
attached, all such Government Property for which he is officially

</div>
<p>Tom read it three times, very slowly. The full meaning of it struck him
suddenly, and he trembled. The wide sheet shook between his hands,
fluttered clear and swooped to the floor. Mick Otter picked it up and
stared at it like an owl.</p>
<p>“I see the mark of your finger in that,” said Tom to the doctor.</p>
<p>“And of the fingers of every other old soldier in Canada,” returned the
doctor.</p>
<p>“When may I show it to Catherine?” asked Tom.</p>
<p>“To-morrow, I think. I am counting on that bit of news to save me a lot
of medicine and professional effort.”</p>
<p>Six days later, very early in the morning, Tom Akerley and Dr. Smith
flew away from Gaspard’s clearings—but not northward across the
height-of-land toward Timbertown. They carried the Winter’s catch of
furs with them, which included several exceptionally fine pelts of otter
and mink and a few of “patch” fox. Tom wore the same clothes, ribbons
and all, in which he had landed so violently amid the young oats on that
June night, now almost a full year ago.</p>
<p>They passed high over Boiling Pot and made a landing in a meadow on the
outskirts of a small town. There they attracted a good deal of
attention; so they took flight again as soon as the doctor had
dispatched a telegram to Timbertown and procured petrol and a map.</p>
<p>Their second and last landing was made in the Agricultural Exhibition
Park of a city. Leaving the machine in the charge of a policeman, and
taking the package of pelts with them, they went to the nearest hotel.
From the hotel Tom rang up Militia Headquarters and the doctor rang up a
dependable dealer in furs.</p>
<p>An hour later, Tom gave his name to an orderly. The orderly was back in
fifteen seconds.</p>
<p>“The general will see you now, sir,” he said. “This way, if you please.”</p>
<p>He opened a door and backed inwards with it, keeping his hand on the
knob.</p>
<p>“Major T. V. Akerley, M. C.,” he announced; and as Tom crossed the
threshold three paces, halted with a smack of his right heel against his
left and saluted, the door closed behind him.</p>
<p>The Inspector General, a large man in a large suit of gray tweed, looked
up from some papers on his desk and said, “How are you, Akerley? Glad to
see you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir,” returned Tom, standing very stiff.</p>
<p>The general left his desk, advanced and extended his hand. Tom grasped
it.</p>
<p>“Glad to hear the machine is all right,” said the general. “You have had
a long flight. Loosen up, my boy. You are not on the carpet, I’m glad to
say.”</p>
<p>Tom’s back and shoulders relaxed a little.</p>
<p>“I can scarcely believe it, sir,” he replied. “May I ask how it
happened? Did Colonel Nasher say how the trouble began?”</p>
<p>“Something like that,” said the general. “Not of his own free will, of
course. It came hard, but we scared it out of him. One of your men,
Dever by name, told of your speaking to him of poor Angus Bruce just
before you flew away that night. And we had Nasher’s letter objecting to
Bruce’s name on the list of posthumous awards; a letter fairly reeking
with cowardly spite. A disgraceful letter. I looked into that matter and
learned that Nasher and the father of Angus Bruce were enemies of long
standing in their home town. I was inspired to put one and one together
and suspect the result of being two; so I sent for Nasher, to see if the
answer really was two. He came; and I saw at a glance that his wind was
up already. The Vets were hot on his tracks by that time, you know. Half
the old soldiers in Canada had pen in hand, most of them painting you in
colors almost too good to be true; and the remainder demanding to know
why, when and by whom, a person like Nasher had been given a commission.
So, when I asked Nasher, in this very room, what he had said to you
about your friend, young Bruce, fear shook enough of the truth out of
him to satisfy me that you had done exactly what I should have done in
your place.”</p>
<p>“You would have knocked his head clean off, sir,” said Tom.</p>
<p>The general grinned and walked across the room to an open window. He
stood there for half a minute, with his hands behind his back. He turned
suddenly, strode back and laid a hand on the airman’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“If you feel fit for it, Akerley, I shall be glad to have you carry on,”
he said. “The past year can be called sick-leave. There was something of
the sort due you, anyway.”</p>
<p>Tom changed color several times before he found his voice.</p>
<p>“I feel fit for a fight, sir—but not for peace-time duty, I’m afraid,”
he replied. “I feel that I need to be in the woods, sir, where I’ve been
ever since last June. But if you will put me in the Reserve, sir, so
that I may come back if needed—to fight, you know—I’ll be very much
obliged,—as I am about everything now—more than I can say.”</p>
<p>“That shall be done,” said the general. And then he added, “So you’ve
been in the woods? What did you do in the woods?”</p>
<p>“Farmed and trapped, sir. It’s a great life.”</p>
<p>“I believe you. Have you bought land?”</p>
<p>“Not yet, sir; but I hope to do so.”</p>
<p>“That reminds me! You must go to the Pay Office. Show them this receipt
for the machine you brought back.”</p>
<p>Then the general walked Tom to the door, still with a hand on his
shoulder, and opened the door. They halted and faced each other on the
threshold.</p>
<p>“Did Angus Bruce get his M. C., sir?” asked Tom.</p>
<p>“He did,” replied the general. “His mother has it. And that reminds me!
You are improperly dressed, Akerley.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry, sir,” returned Tom, in confusion. “I hadn’t any other
clothes to put on.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I refer to,” said the general, placing a finger-tip on
the ribbon of the Military Cross on Tom’s left breast. “You have been
awarded a bar to this. Get it and put it up before you go back to the
woods, or there’ll be trouble. Send me your permanent address. Good-by.
Good luck.”</p>
<p>It was a long and round-about journey back to Gaspard’s clearings. But
Tom Akerley made it with a light and eager heart, thinking fearlessly of
the past and dreaming fearlessly of the future.</p>
